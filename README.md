# wpi4YearPlanner
This site allows WPI students to plan their 4 year schedule at WPI, checking graduation requirements as well as course requirements to help students plan their college expirience.
Students are able to drag and drop courses, with various warnings updating automatically, such as taking too many courses in a semester or taking courses that do not have previous requirements/recommendations fulfilled.
