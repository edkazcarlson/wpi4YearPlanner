I\n \nThe object of this course is a comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic\nengineering principles covering the entire application spectrum from static to\n dynamic field phenomena.\nThe starting point will be the basic electric and magnetic field definitions of Coulomb\n and Biot-Savart leading to Gauss\u2019s and Ampere\u2019s laws. They form the foundation of electro- and magnetostatics fields. Students will examine capacitive and inductive\n systems and relate them to lumped element circuit models. By introducing tempora l\nand spatial magnetic flux variations, Faraday\u2019s law is established. The engineering \nimplications of this law are investigated in terms of transformer and motor actions.\n Incorporation of the displacement current density into Ampere\u2019s law and combining it \nwith Faraday\u2019s law will then culminate in the complete set of Maxwell\u2019s field equations.\n As a result of these equations, students will develop the concept of wave propagation in \nthe time and frequency domain with practical applications such as wireless communication,\n radar, Global Positioning Systems, and microwave circuits. \nRecommended background: ECE 2019.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
