{"title": "THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF NMR SPECTROSCOPY", "level": "536", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "This course emphasizes the fundamental aspects \nof 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy \n(NMR). The theory of pulsed Fourier\n transform NMR is presented through the use of\n vector diagrams. A conceptual nonmathematical\n approach is employed in discussion of NMR \ntheory. The course is geared toward an audience\n which seeks an understanding of NMR theory\n and an appreciation of the practical applications of\nNMR in chemical analysis. Students are exposed\n to hands-on NMR operation. Detailed instructions \nare provided and each student is expected to\n carry out his or her own NMR experiments on a\n Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz NMR spectrometer.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
