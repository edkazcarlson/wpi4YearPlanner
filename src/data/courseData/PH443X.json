{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM INFORMATION", "level": "443X", "abbreviation": "PH", "description": "This course is an introduction to the basic ideas of quantum information. Topics covered will include qubits or two-state quantum systems, physical realizations of qubits, the formalism for treating small numbers of qubits, entanglement and non- locality, gate operations on qubits, the circuit model of quantum computation and some simple quantum algorithms.\r\n\r\nRecommended background: Students should have mathematical preparation in ordinary differential equations, vector and tensor analysis, complex variables and linear algebra. In addition, they should have taken an undergraduate course in quantum mechanics (at the level of PH3401 at WPI).\r\n", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
