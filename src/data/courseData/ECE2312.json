{"title": "DISCRETE-TIME SIGNAL AND SYSTEM ANALYSIS", "level": "2312", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course provides an introduction to the time and frequency domain analysis of\ndiscrete-time signals and linear systems. Topics include sampling and quantization,\ncharacterization of discrete-time sequences, the discrete-time Fourier transform, the discrete Fourier transform and its applications, the Z transform and its applications, convolution, characterization of FIR and IIR discrete-time \nsystems, and the analysis and design of discrete-time filters. The course will include a focus on applications such as sampling and quantization, audio processing, navigation systems, and communications. Extensive use will be made of simulation tools including Matlab.\nRecommended background: MA 2051, ECE 2311 and a prior course in computer programming such as CS 2301 or CS 1101/2/4.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
