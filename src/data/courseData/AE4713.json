{"title": "SPACECRAFT DYNAMICS AND CONTROL", "level": "4713", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "Cat. I\nThe course covers broad topics in spacecraft attitude dynamics, stability and control. The course includes a review of particle and two-body dynamics and introduction to rigid body dynamics. Orbital and attitude maneuvers are presented. Attitude control devices and momentum exchange techniques such as spinners, dual spinners, gravity gradient, and geomagnetic torques are presented.\nAttitude sensors/actuators are presented and the attitude control problem is introduced. Gyroscopic instruments are introduced and demonstrated in the laboratory. Open-loop stability analysis for a variety of equilibrium conditions is discussed. Control using momentum exchange and mass expulsion (thrusters) devices is discussed. \n\nRecommended background: astronautics (ME 2713 or equivalent), dynamics (ES 2503, PH 2201 or equivalent).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
