I\n \nThis course will examine the dynamic nature of solutions at the molecular level, and will develop an understanding of the mathematical aspects of molecular dynamics and equilibrium. Reaction kinetics will be outlined in detail leading into exploration of various fundamentals and examples of equilibrium processes in the gas phase as well as in solution, including acid-base chemistry and precipitation.   Principles of thermodynamics will be introduced (entropy, free energy), and relationships with equilibrium will be explored.  Case studies in current topics will be emphasized throughout the course.\n  Recommended background: Properties of matter, basic bonding theory, Lewis structures and molecular orbitals, intermolecular forces. Redox reactions, solution thermodynamics, colligative properties, balancing of chemical reactions. See CH1010 and CH1020.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
