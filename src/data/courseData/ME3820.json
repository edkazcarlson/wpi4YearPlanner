I\n \nThis introductory course in modern control systems will give students an \nunderstanding of the basic techniques, and the range of equipment used in most\n computer controlled manufacturing operations. The class work is reinforced by \nhands-on laboratories in the Robotics/CAM lab. Modeling and analysis of \nmachining processes, and applications of PLC (programmable logic control) are \nincluded.\n \nClass topics include: Manufacturing Automation, Microcomputers for Process\n Monitoring and Control, Computer Numerical Control, Switching Theory and \nLadder Logic, Transducers and Signal Conditioning, and Closed Loop Digital\n Control. The laboratories allow students to program and implement several\n types of the controllers, and will provide an introduction to the topic of\n industrial robotics. \nRecommended background: manufacturing (ME 1800), materials processing\n (ME 2820), elementary computer/logic device programming.", "req": [[["ME"], ["1800"]], [["ME"], ["2820"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
