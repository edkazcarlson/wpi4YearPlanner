This course is taught in Spanish.\n \n     Recommended background: SP 3521 (Advanced Spanish I) and SP 3522\n (Advanced Spanish II) or equivalent. \nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["SP"], ["3521"]], [["SP"], ["3522"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
