{"title": "MODERN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY METHODS", "level": "2650", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis laboratory course emphasizes principles, techniques, and instrumentation employed in modern physical chemistry with a view towards applications throughout the molecular sciences.  Investigations include chemical thermodynamics and phase equilibria; gas-phase, solution-phase, and interfacial reaction kinetics and dynamics; and molecular modeling of small molecules.  Emphasis includes data collection, interpretation, error analysis, and write-up.\n  Recommended background: Fundamentals in chemistry (see CH1010 \u2013 CH1040), knowledge in thermodynamics (see CH3510).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
