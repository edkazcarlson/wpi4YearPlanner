{"title": "TURBOMACHINERY", "level": "5104", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "This course is an introduction to the fluid mechanics \nand thermodynamics of turbomachinery \nfor propulsion and power generation applications.\n Axial and centrifugal compressors will be discussed\n as well as axial and radial flow turbines. Analysis \nof the mean line flow in compressor and turbine \nblade rows and stages will be discussed. The blade-to-\nblade flow model will be presented and axisymmetric\nflow theory introduced. Three-dimensional\n flow, i.e. secondary flows, will also be discussed. \nStudents cannot receive credit for this course if they \nhave taken the Special Topics (ME 593H) version of \nthe same course.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
