{"title": "LIPIDS AND BIOMEMBRANE FUNCTIONS", "level": "4120", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "Cat. I\nOriented around biological membranes, this course begins with a description of lipids and proteins forming biomembranes. Permeability and the mechanism of transmembrane mass transport are presented. Transport of electrons and redox equivalents is explained within the context of aerobic production of ATP and plant photosynthesis. Finally the transport of information across biomembranes in signal transduction and neurotransmission are discussed.\n  Recommended background: Knowledge of organic chemistry fundamentals as well as concepts including protein structure and folding, catalytic mechanics, enzyme kinetics, and ATP synthesis and hydrolysis mechanisms.  See CH2310, BB2550, and CH4110 or equivalent.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
