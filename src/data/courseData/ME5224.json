{"title": "AIR VEHICLE DYNAMICS AND CONTROL", "level": "5224", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "This course covers the fundamentals of the dynamics of rigid bodies and their motion under the influence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces. General equations of aircraft motion will be developed, followed by concepts of static and dynamic stability. Trim and linearization will be discussed, and the stability analysis of lateral and longitudinal modes in the linearized equations will be introduced. Stability augmentation via feedback control will be discussed. Aspects of aircraft navigation, guidance, and flight trajectory optimization will also be introduced.  Prerequisites: Familiarity with the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies is required. Familiarity with ordinary differential equations is recommended. Familiarity with aircraft dynamics and control at the undergraduate level is beneficial, but not necessary.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
