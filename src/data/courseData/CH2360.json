The course will provide sufficient training in laboratory technique so that no previous laboratory experience beyond that of general chemistry is required. This course may be taken concurrently or following lecture courses in organic chemistry. Recommended for pre-medical students and students majoring in disciplines outside of chemistry and biochemistry that desire laboratory experience in basic methods of organic synthesis. \n  Recommended background: Fundamentals of chemistry, basic chemistry laboratory techniques (e.g., basic synthesis, spectral analysis and chemical separation skills).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
