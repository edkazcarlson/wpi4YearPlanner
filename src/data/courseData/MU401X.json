{"title": "ARTIFICIAL COMPOSITION", "level": "401X", "abbreviation": "MU", "description": "In her notes about Charles Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace imagined a computer that could compose elaborate pieces of music. Almost 200 years later, technologies such as Amper Music, LANDR, Cybernetic Poet, and Taroko Gorge have entered domains that have defined human creativity and expressivity. How are we to understand such systems and their output? To what extent can a machine voice that which is elementally human? To what extent are we mechanical or algorithmic in the process of composition? How do the natural and the naturalized relate to artifice and the artificial in this context? In this multidisciplinary course we will bring together computer science, literary studies, and music analysis to explore techniques and technologies including algorithmic composition, asemic writing, automatic writing, machine learning, and human-machine interaction. Project work might include creative, critical, or hybrid interventions concerned with compositional systems, literary works, and/or musical productions.\nRecommended background: understanding of basic music theory (e.g. MU 1511, Introduction to Music or MU 1611, Fundamentals of Music); and/or coursework in Creative Writing / English (e.g. EN 1251, Introduction to Literature, or EN 2219, Creative Writing, or EN 3219, Advanced Creative Writing); and/or work in Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine learning (e.g. CS 4100, 4341, 534, 539, or 540).", "req": [[["MU"], ["1511"]], [["MU"], ["1611"]], [["EN"], ["1251"]], [["EN"], ["2219"]], [["EN"], ["3219"]], [["CS"], ["4100"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
