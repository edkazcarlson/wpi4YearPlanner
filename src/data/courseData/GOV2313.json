This course addresses the\n concept of intellectual property and the public policies that support the law of\n patent, copyright and trademark. Subjects include the process of obtaining \npatents, trademarks and copyrights; requirements of originality and, for patents,\n utility; infringement issues; and the problems posed by international trade and\n efforts to address them through the World Intellectual Property Organization.\n \n     Recommended background: GOV 1310 or GOV 2310.\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["GOV"], ["1310"]], [["GOV"], ["2310"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
