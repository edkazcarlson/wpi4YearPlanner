{"title": "BIOMATERIALS LAB", "level": "3811", "abbreviation": "BME", "description": "Cat I (1/6 units)\nThis laboratory-driven course provides hands-on experience in the design, fabrication and characterization of biomaterials for medical applications. Students will use synthetic and natural polymer materials to fabricate a scaffold for applications such as tissue engineering, wound healing or controlled drug delivery. A challenge-based laboratory project will be assigned which will require the students to design a biomaterial scaffold that meets specific design criteria, and quantitatively assess the properties of this scaffold to evaluate how well the criteria were met. Design criteria may include mechanical strength, biocompatibility, porosity, degradation rate, or release kinetics. Students will complete the project at their own pace in a team setting and communicate their findings effectively.\n     Recommended background: Basic chemistry (CH 1010 and CH 1020) and a knowledge of material science (ES 2001) or equivalent.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
