{"title": "SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN", "level": "510", "abbreviation": "SYS", "description": "This course will study and contrast various important architectural frameworks, representations, tools, and methodologies in order to provide scalable and flexible approaches for enterprises operating in dynamic and complex environments. Enterprise-level system architecting tools will be discussed and demonstrated. At a minimum, the DoDAF, FEAF, Zachman, and TOGAF architectural frameworks will be discussed in depth. Other topics will include analysis of architectural alternatives to meet physical and logical objectives and providing information and systems assurance in an environment that takes people, processes, and technology into account. Modeling tools such as UML/SysML and the use of model-driven architectures will be presented. Validation of the architecture with stakeholders will be discussed. Methods of identifying risks and opportunities associated with the architectural choice will be explored. Practical examples will be included for illustration.\n(Prerequisite: SYS 501 Concepts of Systems Engineering)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
