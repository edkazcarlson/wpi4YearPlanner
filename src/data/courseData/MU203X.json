{"title": "MUSIC IN TIME OF CONFLICT", "level": "203X", "abbreviation": "MU", "description": "This course will focus on music that has been composed during, or in response to, war and societal conflicts. Music will be used as a tool and device to examine issues such as wars, genocide, assassinations, religious persecution, refugee/homelessness, and personal suffering. Works to be examined may include: Benjamin Britten\u2019s War Requiem and Olivier Messiaen\u2019s Quartet for the End of Time \u2013 a critique and reaction of World War II; David Lang\u2019s Little Match Girl Passion \u2013 an expression of abuse and homelessness; and James MacMillan\u2019s Cantos Sagrodos \u2013 a work highlighting the tragedies of political repression in Latin America. Along with the music, there may also be discussion of individual artists who have been outspoken about social issues, such as Leonard Bernstein in the 1960s, Dimitri Shostakovich under Stalin\u2019s rule, and contemporary pop and jazz artists.\nRecommended background: Basic knowledge of reading music, such as personal experience, participating in ensembles, or music courses (MU 1611: Fundamentals of Music I, or MU 1511: Introduction to Music).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
