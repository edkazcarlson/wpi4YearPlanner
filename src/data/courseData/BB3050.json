{"title": "CANCER BIOLOGY", "level": "3050", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "Cat. I\nIn this course, students will learn and apply advanced cellular and molecular biology concepts to understand causes and consequences of cancer cell transformation. Through an integration of primary literature and lecture material students will explore how research into basic mechanisms of cancer biology is used to identify therapeutic targets, and inform drug design. This course will cover discussion of the hallmarks of cancer including the deregulation of cell growth, cell death, and metabolism; corruption of genome stability, evasion of immune response, and metastatic potential.\n  Recommended background: A thorough understanding of genetics (BB 2920 or equivalent), molecular biology (BB 2950 or equivalent), and cell biology (BB 2550 or equivalent).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
