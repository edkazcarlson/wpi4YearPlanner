{"title": "EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY I: INSTRUMENTAL ANALYSIS", "level": "2640", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "Cat. I \n\nThis laboratory course focuses on the application of modern instrumental\n methods of analysis to chemical, biochemical and environmental problems.\n Practical experience is gained in quantitative electrochemistry, ultraviolet-visible\n spectrophotometry, fluorometry and bioluminescence, high performance liquid \nchromatography, and capillary electrophoresis. Principles of experimental design and execution are developed as student teams select a chemical, biochemical or\n environmental problem, formulate an approach, conduct the analysis, and\n present findings to the class. Methods of data analysis and common statistical\n approaches are emphasized throughout the course. \n\nRecommended background: CH 1010, CH 1020, CH 1030, CH 1040.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
