{"title": "3D ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING", "level": "205X", "abbreviation": "IMGD", "description": "The objective of this course is to teach students how to create 3D environments and props for use in digital models, games and animation. The course will examine different types of architecture used in games. The students will learn how to create interiors and exteriors for both historical and fictional environments; to design, model, texture, and render in high detail; and to import their models into game engines for testing and deployment. Topics may include the proper usage of space, scaling, set design, lighting, surface texturing, and basic camera animation. \n  Recommended Background: Basic 3D modeling skills such as that provided by AR 1101.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
