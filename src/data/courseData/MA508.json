{"title": "MATHEMATICAL MODELING", "level": "508", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "This course introduces mathematical model \nbuilding \nusing dimensional analysis, perturbation \ntheory and variational principles. Models \nare selected from the natural and social sciences \naccording to the interests of the instructor and \nstudents. Examples are: planetary orbits, spring-mass\n systems, fluid flow, isomers in organic chemistry,\n biological competition, biochemical kinetics\n and physiological flow. Computer simulation of \nthese models will also be considered. (Prerequisite: \nknowledge of ordinary differential equations and\n of analysis at the level of MA 501 is assumed.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
