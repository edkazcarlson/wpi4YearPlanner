{"title": "SPECTROSCOPY IN ORGANIC AND POLYMER CHEMISTRY", "level": "1040", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "Cat. I\n \nWe will examine the nature of molecular motions and their interaction with electromagnetic radiation, which provides us with all of our structural information about molecules. In addition, students will be introduced to the fundamentals of mass spectrometry and electrochemistry. The concepts of these techniques will be discussed in the context of structural organic chemistry and polymer characterization\n  Recommended background: Properties of matter, basic bonding theory, Lewis structures and molecular orbitals, intermolecular forces. Redox reactions, solution thermodynamics, colligative properties, balancing of chemical reactions. Reaction kinetics, equilibrium processes, acid-base chemistry and principles of thermodynamics (entropy, free energy). See CH1010, CH1020 and CH1030.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
