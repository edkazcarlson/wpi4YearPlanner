{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO BIOMATERIALS", "level": "2001", "abbreviation": "BME", "description": "Cat. I This beginning course provides important background for all science and engineering disciplines regarding the capabilities and limitations of materials relevant to the development of medical devices. Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structureproperty-processing relationships in biomaterials, specifically metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties. This knowledge is then applied to material selection decisions for the design of medical devices and engineered tissues. Recommended background: prior knowledge of college-level chemistry and physics.\u00a0Students who have previously received credit for ES 2001 or BME 2811 may not receive credit for BME 2001.\r\n", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
