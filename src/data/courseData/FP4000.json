{"title": "FIRE LABORATORY", "level": "4000", "abbreviation": "FP", "description": "Cat. I\r\nThis course will cover experimental methods used in fire research as well as other thermal-fluid topic areas. Students will learn fundamentals of metrology (calibration, sensor response constraints, uncertainty quantification), standard tests in fire research (i.e. cone calorimeter, fire propagation apparatus, etc.), as well as other measurement methods (thermocouples, heat flux gauges, velocimetry, thermometry, etc.). Students will also learn design of experiments and conduct a large-scale experiment in the UL performance lab.\u00a0Recommended background: MA 2051 Differential Equations and ES 3001 Thermodynamics.\r\n\u00a0\r\n", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
