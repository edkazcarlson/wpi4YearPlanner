{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS (FORMERLY ES 2201)", "level": "1001", "abbreviation": "RBE", "description": "Cat. I\n \nMultidisciplinary introduction to robotics, involving concepts from the fields of\nelectrical engineering, mechanical engineering and computer science. Topics \ncovered include sensor performance and integration, electric and pneumatic\n actuators, power transmission, materials and static force analysis, controls and \nprogrammable embedded computer systems, system integration and robotic \napplications. Laboratory sessions consist of hands-on exercises and team projects\n where students design and build mobile robots. \nUndergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and for ES 2201.\nRecommended background: mechanics (PH 1110/ PH 1111).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
