{"title": "INTEGRATION OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION", "level": "535", "abbreviation": "CE", "description": "As an interactive case study of the project development\n process, student groups design a facility and\n prepare a construction plan, including cost and \nschedule, to build the project. The students present \ntheir design-build proposal to participating\n industrial clients. Emphasis is on developing skills \nto generate, evaluate and select design alternatives \nthat satisfy the needs of the owner and the constraints \nimposed by codes and regulations, as well\n as by the availability of construction resources.\n Emphasis is also in developing team-building skills\n and efficient communication. Computer-based\n methods for design, construction cost estimating \nand scheduling, and personal communications are\nextensively used. The interactive case study is specifically\n chosen to balance the content between design, \nconstruction engineering and management.\n Students taking this course are expected to have a \nbackground in at least two of these disciplines.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
