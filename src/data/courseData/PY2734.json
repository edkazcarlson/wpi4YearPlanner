{"title": "PHILOSOPHY AND SPIRITUALITY", "level": "2734", "abbreviation": "PY", "description": "Cat. II\nSpirituality is a philosophical perspective which stresses the role of virtue in happiness and morality; a psychological perspective on emotions and desire; and an essential dimension of religious life. Found in all religions, it is also personally important for the tens of millions who describe themselves as \"spiritual but not religious.\" This course will investigate the many dimensions of spiritual thought and practice, focusing on questions such as: What similarities/differences exist among the spiritual teachings of traditional religions? What is a spiritual experience, a spiritual lesson, a spiritual life? What is the role of spiritual practices such as yoga, meditation, and prayer? What is the place of spirituality in medicine (e.g.,\nmeditation as treatment for stress), our relation to nature (e.g., the experience of a sunset), and political life (e.g., Gandhi, King, spiritual environmentalism)? Beyond scientific knowledge, technological expertise, and common sense, is there such a thing as wisdom?\n     Recommended background: PY/RE 1731, Introduction to Philosophy and Religion.\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
