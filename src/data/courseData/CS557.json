{"title": "SOFTWARE SECURITY DESIGN AND ANALYSIS", "level": "557", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "Software is responsible for enforcing many central \nsecurity goals in computer systems. These goals \ninclude authenticating users and other external\n principals, authorizing their actions, and ensuring \nthe integrity and confidentiality of their data.\n This course studies how to design, implement,\n and analyze mechanisms to enforce these goals in \nboth web systems and programs in traditional languages.\n Topics include: identifying programming\nchoices that lead to reliable or flawed security\n outcomes, successful and unsuccessful strategies\n for incorporating cryptography into software,\n and analysis techniques that identify security \nvulnerabilities. The course will cover both practical\n and theoretical aspects of secure software, and \nwill include a substantial secure software design \nproject. (Prerequisites: Programming and software \nengineering experience (commensurate with an\n undergraduate Computer Science major), and \nbackground in foundational models of computing\n systems (on par with CS 5003 or CS 503).)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
