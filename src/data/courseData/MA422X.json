{"title": "TOP NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS OF THE CENTURY", "level": "422X", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "This course will highlight top algorithms that have tremendous impact on the development and practice of modern science and engineering. Class discussions will focus on introducing students to the mathematical theory behind the algorithms, and their applications. In particular, the course will address issues of computational efficiency, implementation, and error analysis. Algorithms to be considered may include the Fast Multipole Method, Metropolis Algorithm for the Monte Carlo Method, Fast Fourier Transform, Kalman filters and Singular Value Decomposition. Students will be expected to apply these algorithms to real-world problems. For example, we will look at image processing and audio compression (Fast Fourier Transform), recommendation systems (Singular Value Decomposition), and the tracking and prediction of an object\u2019s position (Kalman Filters). In addition to studying these algorithms, students will learn about high performance computing and will have access to a machine with parallel and gpu capabilities to run code for applications with large data sets.\n     Recommended background: MA2071 (Linear Algebra), MA2621 or MA2631 (Probability), MA3257 (Numerical Methods for Calculus and Differential Equations), MA3457 (Numerical Methods for Linear and NonLinear Systems), at least one course in Computer Science. The ability to write computer programs in a scientific language is assumed.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
