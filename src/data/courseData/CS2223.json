I\nBuilding on a fundamental knowledge of data structures, data abstraction\ntechniques, and mathematical tools, a number of examples of algorithm design \nand analysis, worst case and average case, will be developed.\n\nTopics include greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming,\nheuristics, and probabilistic algorithms. Problems will be drawn from areas such \nas sorting, graph theory, and string processing. The influence of the computational\nmodel on algorithm design will be discussed.\n Students will be expected to perform analysis on a variety of algorithms.\nRecommended background: CS 2102 and CS 2022.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
