{"title": "ADVANCED COMPUTER NETWORKS", "level": "4516", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "Cat. II\nThis course provides an in-depth look into computer networks. While repeating\nsome of the areas from CS 3516, the goal is to go deeper into computer networks topics. This in-depth treatment in topics such as routing, congestion control, wireless layer protocols and physical signaling considerations will require the use of basic queuing theory and probability to provide a more formal treatment of computer networks performance. Other topics covered include: LAN and WLAN technologies, mobile wireless networks, sensor networks, optical networks, network security, intrusion detection and network management. Students will be expected to do more sophisticated network programming than seen in CS 3516 and will conduct laboratory activities involving measuring the performance of modern networking applications running on both wired networks and infrastructure wireless networks. \nUndergraduate credit may not be earned both for this course and for CS 513. \n     Recommended background: CS 3013, CS 3516, and knowledge of probability. The course assumes a familiarity with operating systems including Unix or Linux, and significant experience with C/C++.\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
