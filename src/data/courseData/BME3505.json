{"title": "SOLID BIOMECHANICS LABORATORY: TECHNIQUES", "level": "3505", "abbreviation": "BME", "description": "Cat. I (1/6 units)\nThis laboratory-driven solid biomechanics course provides hands-on experience in\ncharacterizing the mechanical properties of biological tissues such as bone, tendons, ligaments, skin, and blood vessels and their synthetic analogs. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the course material by performing uniaxial tension and compression, bending, and torsion tests on hard and soft tissues using industry-standard testing equipment and completing mechanical and statistical analysis of the data.\n     Recommended background: A solid knowledge of mechanics of materials (ES2502) and material science (ES 2001). \nStudents who have previously received credit for BME3504 cannot receive credit for this course.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
