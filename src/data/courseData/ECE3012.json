{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO CONTROL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING", "level": "3012", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "This course provides an introduction to the analysis and design of continuous-time control systems. Topics covered in the course include: modeling in the frequency and time domain, characteristics of control systems time response, reduction of multiple subsystems, analysis of systems transient response, stability, steady-state errors, root locus techniques, design of PI, PD, and PID controllers via root locus, frequency response techniques, and design via frequency response. The course will not have a formal laboratory. It will include projects which will require the use of software such as MATLAB, Simulink, or LabVIEW for analysis and design of control systems.\n     Recommended Background: Ordinary Differential Equations (MA 2051), Sensors, Circuits, and Systems (ECE 2019), and Continuous-time Signal and System Analysis (ECE 2311).\n     Students may not receive credit for both ES3011 and ECE3012.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
