II\nThis course is intended to acquaint the student with the measurable properties \nof nuclei and the principles necessary to perform these measurements. The\n major part of the course will be an introduction to the theory of nuclei. \nThe principal topics will include binding energy, nuclear models and nuclear\n reactions. The deuteron will be discussed in detail and the nuclear shell model\n will be treated as well as the nuclear optical model.\n     Recommended background: some knowledge of the phenomena of modern\n physics at the level of an introductory physics course and knowledge of\n intermediate level quantum mechanics.\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
