{"title": "AEROSPACE STRUCTURES", "level": "3712", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "This course provides an overview of theoretical and practical aspects of mechanics of structures relevant to aerospace applications under different loading conditions. It begins with an overview of energy methods used in mechanics of aerospace structures. Applied topics include general torsion of solid circular and noncircular cross sections, torsion of thin-walled multi-celled members, flexural shear flow in and shear center of thin walled multi-celled members, buckling and stability of columns, and aerospace structures under combined loading. The laboratory component of this course will provide students with testing and measurement experience related to determination of shear center and the behavior of structures undergoing buckling.\n     Recommended background: Introductory level aerospace structures (AE 2712 or equivalent.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
