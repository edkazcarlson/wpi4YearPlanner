{"title": "MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND GENETIC ENGINEERING: APPROACHES AND APPLICATIONS", "level": "356X", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "In this laboratory based course, students will learn to use current techniques in molecular and genetic engineering to address authentic research questions. Students will design and execute experiments to assess hypotheses, and evaluate data relative to those hypotheses. Specific approaches may include the generation of novel plasmids, genes, and cells, designed to specifically address contemporary problems in biology and biomedical science. In each offering, the problem addressed will be selected from and the results contribute to current faculty research initiatives.    \n  Recommended background: Working knowledge of the principles of molecular biology (BB 2950 or BB 2920 or equivalent) and cell biology (BB 2550 or equivalent), as well as relevant biology laboratory experience (BB 2901 or BB 2905).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
