{"title": "ADVANCED DIGITAL SYSTEM DESIGN WITH FPGAs", "level": "3829", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "This course covers the systematic design of advanced digital systems using FPGAs. The emphasis is on top-down design starting with high level models using a hardware description language (such as VHDL or Verilog) as a tool for the design, synthesis, modeling, test bench development, and testing and verification of complete digital systems. These types of systems include the use of embedded soft core processors as well as lower level modules created from custom logic or imported IP blocks. Interfaces will be developed to access devices external to the FPGA such as memory or peripheral communication devices. The integration of tools and design methodologies will be addressed through a discussion of system on a chip (SOC) integration, methodologies, design for performance, and design for test. \nTopics: Hardware description languages, system modeling, synthesis, simulation and testing of digital circuits; Design integration to achieve specific system design goals including architecture, planning and integration, and testing; Use of soft core and IP modules to meet specific architecture and design\ngoals. Laboratory exercises: Students will design and implement a complete\nsophisticated embedded digital system on an FPGA. HDL design of digital systems including lower level components and integration of higher level IP cores, simulating the design with test benches, and synthesizing and implementing these designs with FPGA development boards including interfacing to external devices. \nRecommended background: ECE 2029 and ECE 2049.\nStudents who have received credit for ECE 3810 may not receive credit for ECE 3829.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
