{"title": "GAMES FOR UNDERSTANDING COMPLEXITY", "level": "1505", "abbreviation": "SS", "description": "Cat. I\nThis course addresses the theory and practice of developing solutions to complex social and environmental problems through interaction with roleplaying games and computer simulations designed to promote learning and improve decision-making. By interacting with a selection of games and case studies, students will learn to recognize the systemic causes of complex social and environmental problems and gain experience developing and using simulations to test policies for creating sustainable futures. Special attention will be given to appropriate modeling practices and the design of simulation experiments. The course is run in a laboratory format in which students work in groups to play games, develop simulation models and present them to the class for feedback before they revise and refine their work iteratively for final evaluation. \nRecommended background: None \nStudents who completed SS150X cannot receive credit for SS1505.", "req": [[["SS"], ["150X"]], [["SS"], ["1505"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
