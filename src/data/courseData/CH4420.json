{"title": "APPLICATION OF MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY TO METAL COMPLEXES", "level": "4420", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "Cat. I\nComplexes of the transition metals are discussed. Covered are the electronic structures of transition metal atoms and ions, and the topological and electronic structures of their complexes. Symmetry concepts are developed early in the course and used throughout to simplify treatments of electronic structure. The molecular orbital approach to bonding is emphasized. The pivotal area of organotransition metal chemistry is introduced, with focus on complexes of carbon monoxide, metal-metal interactions in clusters, and catalysis by metal complexes. Recommended background: CH 1010 - CH 1040, CH 2640 - CH 2670, CH 3410, CH 3530, and CH 3550. \n  Recommended background: Fundamental understanding of atomic, molecular and solid state structures and properties. Thermodynamic stabilities of inorganic species. Acidity, solubility and precipitation of inorganic compounds (see CH3410).", "req": [[["CH"], ["3410"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
