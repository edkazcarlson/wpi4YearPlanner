{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR ENGINEERING PROBLEMS", "level": "2312", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "Cat. I\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce concepts of programming and numerical methods using Matlab within an engineering framework. The course will review basic linear algebra, statics, stress analysis, and engineering governing equations with solution pathways developed and presented as numerical programming problems. The fundamental programming techniques cover a variety of input and output formats typically encountered in engineering situations. Control and conditional loops, recognizing and controlling numerical error, numerical integration and differentiation will be introduced and developed within an engineering framework. \n  Recommended background: Statics (ES 2501), Stress Analysis (ES 2502), General Physics-Mechanics (PH 1110), Differential and Integral Calculus (MA 1021, MA 1022) or equivalents.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
