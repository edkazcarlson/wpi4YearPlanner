{"title": "COMPUTATIONAL BIOMECHANICS", "level": "450X", "abbreviation": "BME", "description": "This course will focus on using computational modeling approaches, particularly, finite element models, to simulate, validate, and analyze the biomechanics involved in soft and hard tissue deformation and stress/strain analysis in quasi-static or impact conditions. First, students will be introduced to the process of setting specific analytical goals and establishing the need for a specific quantitative biomechanical model. Then, basic underlying principles of forward and inverse static/dynamics simulations are covered. Finally, multi-scale and multi-step models will be introduced. During the process, material models and property assignment will also be covered. Model building, testing, optimization and validation with experimental data will be discussed. An introduction to tools and techniques used in computational biomechanics will be provided.\n  Recommended background: Basic knowledge of solid mechanics (e.g., ES 2501, ES 2502, ES 2503, ME 3501 or equivalent), differential and integral calculus (e.g., MA 2051 or equivalent).", "req": [[["ES"], ["2501"]], [["ES"], ["2502"]], [["ES"], ["2503"]], [["ME"], ["3501"]], [["MA"], ["2051"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
