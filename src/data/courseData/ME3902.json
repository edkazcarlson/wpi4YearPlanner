{"title": "PROJECT-BASED ENGINEERING EXPERIMENTATION", "level": "3902", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "Cat. I This course is designed to develop experimental skills in engineering measurement methods, based on electronic instrumentation and computer-based data acquisition systems, such as the Raspberry Pi (a primarily digital microprocessor) and an Arduino (a primarily analog microcontroller). The lectures are concerned with the engineering design requirements as well as the principles of instrumentation, whereas the laboratory modules afford the student an opportunity to use these devices in actual experiments. Lecture topics include: discussions of standards, measurement and sensing devices, experiment planning, data acquisition, analysis of experimental data, and report writing. Laboratory experiments address mechanical (force/torque/strain measurements, motion/vibration measurements), energy (heat transfer, temperature, flow measurements), materials measurements (materials processing, measurement of strain and position in mechanical testing of materials), and instrumentation. The course culminates with an open-ended project of the students choosing. This open-ended project will illuminate the skills gained by the student to utilize multiple sensors and equipment to monitor and/or control physical situations.\r\n\r\nRecommended background: introductory heat transfer (ES3003 or equivalent), introductory stress and dynamic mechanics (ES 2502 & ES 2503 or equivalents), introductory electrical and computer engineering (ES2010 or equivalent) and introductory materials (such as ES 2001 or equivalent).\r\n", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
