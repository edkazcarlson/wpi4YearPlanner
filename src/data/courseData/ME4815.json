I\n \nThis course introduces students to robotics within manufacturing systems.\n Topics include: classification of robots, robot kinematics, motion generation and \ntransmission, end effectors, motion accuracy, sensors, robot control and\n automation. This course is a combination of lecture, laboratory and project\n work, and utilizes industrial robots. Through the laboratory work, students will\n become familiar with robotic programming (using a robotic programming \nlanguage VAL II) and the robotic teaching mode. The experimental component \nof the laboratory exercise measures the motion and positioning capabilities of\n robots as a function of several robotic variables and levels, and it includes the use \nof experimental design techniques and analysis of variance. \nRecommended background: manufacturing (ME 1800), kinematics\n (ME 3310), control (ES 3011), and computer programming.", "req": [[["ME"], ["1800"]], [["ME"], ["3310"]], [["ES"], ["3011"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
