{"title": "STRESS ANALYSIS", "level": "2502", "abbreviation": "ES", "description": "Cat. I\nThis is an introductory course that addresses the analysis of basic mechanical and structural elements.  Topics include general concepts of stresses, strains, and material properties of common engineering materials. Also covered are two-dimensional stress transformations, principal stresses, Mohr\u2019s circle and deformations due to mechanical and thermal effects.  Applications are to uniaxially loaded bars, circular shafts under torsion, bending and shearing and deflection of beams, and buckling of columns. Both statically determinate and indeterminate problems are analyzed. \n     Recommended background: ES 2501 or equivalent, differential (MA 1021) and integral (MA 1022) calculus, vector algebra (MA 1023), and double and triple integration (MA 1024).", "req": [[["ES"], ["2501"]], [["MA"], ["1021"]], [["MA"], ["1022"]], [["MA"], ["1023"]], [["MA"], ["1024"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
