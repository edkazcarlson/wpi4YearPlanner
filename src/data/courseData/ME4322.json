{"title": "MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF MECHATRONIC SYSTEMS", "level": "4322", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course introduces students to the modeling and analysis of mechatronic \nsystems. Creation of dynamic models and analysis of model response using the bond graph modeling language are emphasized. Lecture topics include energy \nstorage and dissipation elements, transducers, transformers, formulation of equations for dynamic systems, time response of linear systems, and system \ncontrol through open and closed feedback loops. Computers are used extensively \nfor system modeling, analysis, and control. Hands-on projects will include the \nreverse engineering and modeling of various physical systems. Physical models\n may sometimes also be built and tested.\n \nRecommended background: mathematics (MA 2051, MA 2071), fluids (ES 3004), thermodynamics (ES 3001), mechanics (ES 2501, ES 2503).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
