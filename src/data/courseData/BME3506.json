{"title": "SOLID BIOMECHANICS LABORATORY: APPLICATIONS", "level": "3506", "abbreviation": "BME", "description": "Cat. I (1/6 units)\nThis laboratory-driven solid biomechanics course provides hands-on experience in\ncharacterizing the mechanical properties of biological tissues such as bone, tendons, ligaments, skin, and blood vessels and their synthetic analogs, in the context of an authentic challenge. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the course material from personal observations, measurements, and analysis of biological tissues and synthetic replacement/fixation materials using industry-standard testing equipment. A challenge-based laboratory project will be assigned which will require the students to determine and execute effective test methods at their own pace in a team setting and communicate their findings effectively.\n     Recommended background: Ability to independently perform tensile and bending tests using a uniaxial mechanical testing machine and to perform mechanical and statistical analysis of test data (BME3505). \nStudents who have previously received credit for BME3504 cannot receive credit for this course.", "req": [[["BME"], ["3505"]], [["BME"], ["3504"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
