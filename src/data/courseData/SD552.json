{"title": "SYSTEM DYNAMICS FOR INSIGHT", "level": "552", "abbreviation": "SD", "description": "The objective of this course is to help students\n appreciate and master system dynamics\u2019 unique \nway of using of computer simulation models. The\n course provides tools and approaches for building\n and learning from models. The course covers the \nuse of molecules of system dynamics structure to \nincrease model building speed and reliability. In \naddition, the course covers recently developed eigenvalue-\nbased techniques for analyzing models as\n well as more traditional approaches.
