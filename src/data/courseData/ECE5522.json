{"title": "ADVANCED APPLICATIONS IN PROTECTIVE RELAYING", "level": "5522", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "This graduate level course covers advanced topics in the principles and practices of power system protective relaying. The course seeks to provide an understanding of how protective relays are applied to protect power system components.  While the subject is presented from a theoretical viewpoint, many practical examples are included. Examples specific to both new installations and existing, older facilities will be included. Course content is not specific to any particular manufacturer\u2019s equipment. The course begins with applications of protective devices to generators. This will include distributed generation as well as wind-turbine and inverter-connected sources. Transformer protection is covered next, including application procedures for older, electromechanical relays as well as modern numeric relay designs. A unit on bus protection is covered next, including all typical high-speed and time backup bus protection schemes. Transmission line and distribution feeder protection is covered in detail including both conventional and communications-assisted schemes. The course ends with a unit on other protection applications such as under frequency load shedding, reclosing and out-of-step relaying. (Prerequisite: ECE 5521 Protective Relaying. Note: Credit cannot be awarded for this course if credit has already been received for ECE 5520 Power System Protection and Control.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
