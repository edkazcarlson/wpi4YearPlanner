{"title": "GAS TURBNS FR PRPLSN & PWR GEN", "level": "4710", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "Cat. I \nThis course provides a study of open-cycle and closed-cycle gas turbines. Topics covered include: thermodynamic cycles and fluid dynamics of airbreathing gas turbines (turbojets, turbofans, turboprops), ramjets, and scramjets; thermodynamic cycles and fluid dynamics of closed-cycle gas turbines. Performance of specific engine components such as inlets, combustors, nozzles, as well as axial compressors and turbines will be addressed. \n\nRecommended background: compressible fluid dynamics (AE/ME 3410 or equivalent).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
