Tools \nof data analysis include statistics for determining significance of a result, Laplace \nand Z transforms, convolution, correlation, sampling theorem, Fourier\ntransform, transfer function, coherence function and various filtering techniques.\nThe goal of this course is to offer the students an opportunity to learn\n and model and simulate static and dynamic physiological systems using linear\n systems theory. First principles of chemistry and physics are used to quantitatively\n model physiological systems. Most of the models are based on linear\n systems theory. Simulations and estimation are performed using Matlab and \nalready-developed software.\n Recommended background: BME 2210, CS 1004 or equivalent.", "req": [[["BME"], ["2210"]], [["CS"], ["1004"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
