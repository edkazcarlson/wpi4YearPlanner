{"title": "AXIOMATIC DESIGN OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES", "level": "543", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "The first half of the course covers the axiomatic \ndesign method, applied to simultaneous product\n and process design for concurrent engineering,\n with the emphasis on process and manufacturing \ntool design. Basic design principles as well as \nqualitative and quantitative methods of analysis \nof designs are developed. The second half of the\n course addresses methods of engineering analysis\n of manufacturing processes, to support machine \ntool and process design. Basic types of engineering\n analysis are applied to manufacturing situations, \nincluding elasticity, plasticity, heat transfer, mechanics\n and cost analysis. Special attention will be\n given to the mechanics of machining (traditional,\nnontraditional and grinding) and the production \nof surfaces. Students, work in groups on a series\n of projects.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
