{"title": "INTERMEDIATE PHYSICS LABORATORY", "level": "2651", "abbreviation": "PH", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course offers experience in experimentation and observation for students of\nthe sciences and others. In a series of subject units, students learn or review the\nphysical principles underlying the phenomena to be observed and the basis for \nthe measurement techniques employed. Principles and uses of laboratory \ninstruments including the cathode-ray oscilloscope, meters for frequency, time,\n electrical and other quantities are stressed. In addition to systematic measurement \nprocedures and data recording, strong emphasis is placed on processing of \nthe data, preparation and interpretation of graphical presentations, and analysis\n of precision and accuracy, including determination and interpretation of best \nvalue, measures of error and uncertainty, linear best fit to data, and identification \nof systematic and random errors. Preparation of high-quality experiment reports\n is also emphasized. Representative experiment subjects are: mechanical motions \nand vibrations; free and driven electrical oscillations; electric fields and potential;\n magnetic materials and fields; electron beam dynamics; optics; diffractiongrating\n spectroscopy; radioactive decay and nuclear energy measurements. \n\nRecommended background: the Introductory Physics course sequence or\nequivalent. No prior laboratory background beyond that experience is required.\n Students who have received credit for PH 2600 or PH 3600 may not receive \ncredit for PH 2651.", "req": [[["PH"], ["2600"]], [["PH"], ["3600"]], [["PH"], ["2651"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
