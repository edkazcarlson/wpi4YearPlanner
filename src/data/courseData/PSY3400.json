{"title": "SURVEY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY", "level": "3400", "abbreviation": "PSY", "description": "Cat. II Surveys are everywhere. But good surveys based on sound social science are rare. Conducting a successful survey requires familiarity with the methods and techniques developed by psychologists and other social scientists through long experience to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and validity of survey data. This course will focus on the common mistakes of first time survey researchers and ways to avoid them. Topics covered will include alternatives to survey research, sampling, response rates, questionnaire design and implementation, question wording, pretesting, ethical issues in survey research, and communicating survey results. Special attention will be given to issues related to the use of on-line survey platforms. During the course students will be guided through the development, implementation, and analysis of a survey on a topic of their own choosing.\r\n\r\nThis course is an appropriate methodology course for psychology and other social science majors and can also be taken by students of all majors as preparation for a survey-based IQP or MQP. Recommended background: background in psychological science such as social or cognitive. Students who completed PSY340X cannot receive credit for PSY3400.\r\n", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": -1}
