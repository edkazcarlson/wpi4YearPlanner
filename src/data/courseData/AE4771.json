{"title": "SPACECRAFT AND MISSION DESIGN", "level": "4771", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "Cat. I \nThis course introduces students to design of spacecraft and missions. Students are introduced to the process of designing a spacecraft and major subsystems to meet a specific set of objectives or needs. In addition, students will learn about different spacecraft subsystems and what factors drive their design. Particular emphasis is given to propulsion, power, attitude control, structural and thermal control subsystems. Students work together in teams to apply material learned in the areas of orbital mechanics, space environments, attitude determination and control, space structures, and propulsion to the preliminary design of a spacecraft and mission. The project requirements are selected to reflect real-life missions, and teams are required to design systems which incorporate appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. The teams present their design in a final report and oral presentation. \n\nRecommended background: astronautics (AE 2713 or equivalent), rocket propulsion (AE 4719 or equivalent), spacecraft dynamics and control (AE 4713 or equivalent).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
