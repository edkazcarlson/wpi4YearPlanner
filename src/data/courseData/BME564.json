{"title": "CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY FOR ENGINEERS", "level": "564", "abbreviation": "BME", "description": "An advanced course in cell and molecular biology for engineering graduate students, with an emphasis on molecular approaches to measuring and manipulating cell responses for biomedical engineering applications. Course topics will include in depth exploration of the molecular basis of cellular function, including protein biochemistry, signal transduction, cell-extracellular matrix interactions and regulation of gene expression. Tools and techniques used in modern cell and molecular biology will be discussed in the context of current research literature. \n\nNOTE: This course can be used to satisfy a life science requirement in the graduate biomedical engineering program. It cannot be used to satisfy a biomedical engineering course requirement (undergraduate or graduate).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
