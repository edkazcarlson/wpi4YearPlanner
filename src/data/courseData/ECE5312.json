{"title": "MODERN DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS", "level": "5312", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "This course introduces a rigorous analytical treatment\n of modern digital communication systems,\n including digital modulation, demodulation,\n and optimal receiver design. Error performance \nanalysis of these communication systems when \noperating over either noisy or band-limited channels\n will be conducted. Advanced topics to be \ncovered include a subset of the following: MIMO, \nfading channels, multiuser communications,\n spread spectrum systems, and/or multicarrier \ntransmission. (Prerequisites: An understanding of\nprobability and random processes theory (ECE \n502 or equivalent); an understanding of various\n analog and digital (de)modulation techniques\n (ECE 3311 or equivalent); familiarity with MATLAB \nprogramming.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
