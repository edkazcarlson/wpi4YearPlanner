{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO CONTEMPORARY ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS", "level": "3500", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "Cat. I\nThis course introduces basic concepts underlying the current and future methods of generation, transmission, storage, and use of electric energy.  Beginning with an historical overview of the electric power system that has served well for more than 100 years, the course provides an introduction to the fundamental engineering principles underlying the design and implementation of traditional as well as modern electric power systems.  Energy sources including thermal (combustion, nuclear, geothermal), solar, wind, and chemical (fuel cells) are presented, along with the environmental impacts.  Concepts of three-phase systems, transmission and distribution of power, economic and regulatory aspects, as well as communications, protection, and control systems are included.  Student project work is included.  \nRecommended background:  ECE 2010 or equivalent\nSuggested background:  ECE 2019 or equivalent", "req": [[["ECE"], ["2010"]], [["ECE"], ["2019"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
