{"title": "MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN DECISION MAKING", "level": "2210", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Cat. I\nThis course introduces students to the principles of decision theory as applied to\nthe planning, design and management of complex projects. It will be useful to\n students in all areas of engineering, actuarial mathematics as well as those in \nsuch interdisciplinary areas as environmental studies. It emphasizes quantitative,\n analytic approaches to decision making using the tools of applied mathematics,\n operations research, probability and computations. Topics covered include: the\n systems approach, mathematical modeling, optimization and decision analyses. \nCase studies from various areas of engineering or actuarial mathematics are used\n to illustrate applications of the materials covered in this course. \nRecommended background: MA 1024. \nSuggested background: Familiarity\nwith vectors and matrices. Although the course makes use of computers, no\nprogramming experience is assumed. \n     Students who have received credit for\n CE 2010 may not receive credit for MA 2210. \nIndustrial Engineering majors cannot receive credit for both MA 2210 and BUS 2080.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
