{"title": "REAL-TIME DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING", "level": "4703", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course provides an introduction to the principles of real-time digital signal\nprocessing (DSP). The focus of this course is hands-on development of real-time\n signal processing algorithms using audio-based DSP kits in a laboratory \nenvironment. Basic concepts of DSP systems including sampling and \nquantization of continuous time signals are discussed. Tradeoffs between fixed-point\n and floating-point processing are exposed. Real-time considerations are \ndiscussed and efficient programming techniques leveraging the pipelined and \nparallel processing architecture of modern DSPs are developed. Using the audio-based \nDSP kits, students will implement real-time algorithms for various \nfiltering structures and compare experimental results to theoretical predictions.\n \nRecommended background: ECE 2049, ECE 2312, some prior experience in \nC programming.\n \nSuggested background: ECE 3311.", "req": [[["ECE"], ["2049"]], [["ECE"], ["2312"]], [["ECE"], ["3311"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
