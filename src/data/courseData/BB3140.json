{"title": "EVOLUTION: PATTERN AND PROCESS", "level": "3140", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "Cat. II\nIn this course, students will explore the foundations of micro- and macro-evolutionary theory and will learn to apply these fundamental evolutionary principles through critical analysis of the primary scientific literature. In a course format that emphasizes team-based case studies, discussion of recent and classic papers, and computer simulation of evolutionary processes, students will explore the evolutionary foundations of a wide range of biological disciplines, and will gain experience in critical evaluation of approaches, arguments, and points of view in the field. Topics may include the history of life on Earth; biogeography and the origins of biodiversity; host-pathogen coevolution; and genomic and molecular evolution, among others. \n\nRecommended background: BB2040 (Principles of Ecology), BB2920 (Genetics), MA 1021-1022 (Calculus I and II) or equivalent.\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16 and alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
