{"title": "REGRESSION ANALYSIS", "level": "542", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Regression analysis is a statistical tool that utilizes \nthe relation between a response variable and one \nor more predictor variables for the purposes of \ndescription, prediction and/or control. Successfu l\nuse of regression analysis requires an appreciation \nof both the theory and the practical problems that \noften arise when the technique is employed with \nreal-world data. Topics covered include the theory \nand application of the general linear regression \nmodel, model fitting, estimation and prediction,\n hypothesis testing, the analysis of variance and \nrelated distribution theory, model diagnostics and \nremedial measures, model building and validation,\n and generalizations such as logistic response\n models and Poisson regression. Additional topics \nmay be covered as time permits. Application of \ntheory to real-world problems will be emphasized \nusing statistical computer packages. (Prerequisite:\n knowledge of probability and statistics at the level\nof MA 511 and of matrix algebra is assumed.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
