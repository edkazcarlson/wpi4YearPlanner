{"title": "RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A CHANGING CLIMATE", "level": "402X", "abbreviation": "CE", "description": "This course is intended to provide students with understanding, knowledge, skills and tools to evaluate the risk and resilience of infrastructure components to climate change related and extreme weather events, and to conduct further studies and research on this subject. Methods to consider impact of climate change and extreme weather events on the infrastructure, understand different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, utilize downscaled data for design of infrastructure, estimation of vulnerability, criticality, consequence, risk and resiliency,  in both qualitative and quantitative way, and available adaptation frameworks and tools/software for increasing resiliency will be presented. \n     Recommended background: basic knowledge of applied statistics (MA 2611 or equivalent), probability for applications (MA 2621 or equivalent), statics (CE 2000 or equivalent), structural engineering (CE 3010 or equivalent), and materials of construction (CE 3026 or equivalent).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
