Principles of diffusion and phase transformation are\n applied to the strengthening of commercial alloy systems. Role of crystal lattice \ndefects on material properties and fracture are presented. \nStrongly recommended as a senior-graduate level course for students interested \nin pursuing a graduate program in materials or materials engineering at WPI, or \nother schools.\n \nRecommended background: materials (ES 2001, ME 2820).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
