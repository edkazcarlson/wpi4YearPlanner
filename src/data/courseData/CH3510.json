{"title": "CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS", "level": "3510", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThe content of this course will be the development of the principles of classical\nthermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics will be developed by using a\n series of increasingly complex model systems and a universal equation of state is\n formulated which incorporates the relationships illustrated by these model systems. Using this equation it will be possible to appreciate that thermodynamic \nlaws are applicable to all systems of matter, regardless of their complexity.\n Finally, the principles developed are applied to problems of a chemical nature,\n focusing on predicting the spontaneity of chemical reactions.\n\nThe material in this course will be of greatest interest to those students enrolled\n in the basic sciences including biology, chemistry, and physics, and in applied\nfields such as chemical engineering, materials science and biotechnology. \n\nRecommended background: Students should be familiar with the material \ncovered in the general chemistry sequence CH 1010-1040, and calculus\n including multi variables.", "req": [[["CH"], ["1010"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
