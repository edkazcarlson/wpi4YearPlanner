{"title": "MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS", "level": "5200", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "The course provides fundamentals for vibration\nan alysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic\nsystems. A vibrating system is first modeled \nmathematically as an initial value problem (IVP)\n or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the \nNewton-D\u2019Alembert method and/or the Lagrange \nenergy approach and then solved for various types \nof system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response\n of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, \nboth damped and undamped, is derived for\n free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and \nforced vibration caused by different excitations. \nModal analysis is presented to solve for vibration \nresponse of both multi-degree-of-freedom \n(MDOF) systems and continuous systems with\n distributed parameters. As the basis of modal \nanalysis, the natural frequencies and vibration \nmodes of a linear dynamic system are obtained \nin advance by solving an associated generalized \neigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties\n of the vibration modes with respect to the \nstiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved.\n Computational methods for vibration analysis are \nintroduced. Applications include but are not limited\n to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles \ntraveling on a rough surface, multi-story building\n subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration\n analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.\n Students cannot receive credit for this course if they \nhave taken the Special Topics (ME 593V) version of \nthe same course or ME 522.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
