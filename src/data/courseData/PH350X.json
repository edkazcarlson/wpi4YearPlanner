{"title": "OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS", "level": "350X", "abbreviation": "PH", "description": "The course will cover the optical physics of solid state materials, including the classical description of optical propagation and reflectivity, quantum treatment of absorption and luminescence, and excitonic effects. The phenomena will be illustrated by discussing the optical properties of insulators, semiconductors, metals, as well as their nanostructures. The course will conclude with a brief introduction to nonlinear optics. \nRecommended background: A basic understanding of electricity and magnetism (PH1121 or equivalent), and introduction to quantum mechanics (at level of a modern physics course, PH1130) is recommended.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
