II\nThis course introduces the concepts and principles governing the distribution\n and transport of water in the environment, and also provides a background for \nquantifying hydrologic processes as required for the development of water\n resources projects. Topics include the hydrologic cycle, precipitation, evaporation\n and transpiration, infiltration, runoff analysis, streamflow, hydrologic\nrouting, statistics and probability in hydrology, and the quantification of \nhydrologic processes for water quality protection. The course introduces field\n techniques and the use of hydrologic models for solving problems in water \nresources and hydrology.\n \n     Recommended background: ES 3004.\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
