{"title": "AIRECRAFT DYNAMICS AND CONTROL", "level": "4723", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "The goal of this course is for students to develop, analyze, and utilize models of aircraft dynamics, and to study various aircraft control systems. Topics include: review of linear systems, longitudinal and lateral flight dynamics, simulation methodologies, natural modes of motion, static and dynamic aircraft stability, and aircraft control systems (such as autopilot design, flight path control, and\nautomatic landing). Other topics may include: vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicles and rotorcraft. \n     Recommended background: dynamics (ES 2503, PH 2201 or equivalent).", "req": [[["ES"], ["2503"]], [["PH"], ["2201"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
