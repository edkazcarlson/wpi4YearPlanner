{"title": "FUNDAMENTALS OF SCIENTIFIC TEACHING AND PEDAGOGY", "level": "527", "abbreviation": "ID", "description": "The purpose of this zero credit course is to bolster teaching proficiency for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees through in depth and interactive sessions on the science behind student learning, scientific teaching, assessments and rubrics, active learning, project based learning, inclusive learning environments, teaching philosophies, technology in the classroom, and course design. Participants will learn through both lecture and practicum sessions each week, and will work in small groups to develop a short teachable unit incorporating the techniques learned throughout the course, which they will ultimately present at the conclusion of the series. The course is recommended for all graduate students and postdocs who are pursuing careers that will entail teaching in higher education as well as those interested in learning the fundamentals of pedagogy and effective teaching strategies.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
