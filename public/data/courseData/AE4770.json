{"title": "AIRCRAFT DESIGN", "level": "4770", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "This course introduces students to design of aircraft systems. Students complete a conceptual design of an aircraft in a term-long project. Students are exposed to the aircraft design process, and must establish design specifications, develop and analyze alternative designs, and optimize their designs to meet mission requirements. Students work together in teams to apply material learned in the\nareas of aerodynamics, structures and materials, propulsion, stability and control, and flight mechanics and maneuvers to the preliminary design of an aircraft. The project requirements are selected to reflect real-life aircraft mission requirements, and teams are required to design systems which incorporate\nappropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. The teams present their design in a final report and oral presentation. \n     Recommended background: fluid dynamics (ME 3410, ME 3602 or equivalent), subsonic aerodynamics (ME 3711 or equivalent), aerospace structures (AE 3712 or equivalent), airbreathing propulsion (AE 4710 or equivalent), aircraft dynamics and control (AE 4723 or equivalent).", "req": [[["ME"], ["3410"]], [["ME"], ["3602"]], [["ME"], ["3711"]], [["AE"], ["3712"]], [["AE"], ["4710"]], [["AE"], ["4723"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
