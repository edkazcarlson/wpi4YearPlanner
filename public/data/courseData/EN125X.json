{"title": "INTRO TO CONTEMPORARY CHICANA/O LITERATURE", "level": "125X", "abbreviation": "EN", "description": "This course examines literary works of multiple genres produced by Chicana/o writers from WWII to today, with particular emphasis on the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and the contemporary relevance of issues such as land and education rights for immigrants. Writers studied may include the novelist Sandra Cisneros, the cultural critic Gloria Anzald\u00faa, the musician Lalo Guerrero, the memoirist Reyna Grande, and the short-story writer Kali Fajardo-Anstine.
