I\n \nThe synthesis, isolation, and characterization of inorganic compounds are emphasized. Syntheses of main group compounds, classical transition metal complexes, and organotransition metal compounds are included. In addition to reinforcing and building on standard techniques of synthesis and characterization, several new techniques are introduced: synthesis under inert atmosphere, measurement of magnetic susceptibility by NMR, and cyclic voltammetry. Some exposure to 13C NMR is also provided. The final experiment of the course requires the student to design a synthesis for a compound selected from a list provided, based on strategies learned in the course. \n  Recommended background: Principles of inorganic chemistry, chemical bonding and reactions, thermodynamic stability of inorganic species, solubility and precipitation of inorganic compounds. Advanced chemistry laboratory skills (see CH 2660)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
