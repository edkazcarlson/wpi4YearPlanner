{"title": "DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY", "level": "4895", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Cat. II\nThe course gives an introduction to differential geometry with a focus on Riemannian geometry. Starting with the geometry of curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space and Riemannian metrics in 2 and higher dimensions, the course introduces the first fundamental form, tangent bundles, vector fields, distance functions and geodesics, followed by covariant derivatives and second fundamental form. The proof of Gauss\u2019s Theorema Egregium is highlighted. Additional topics are by instructor\u2019s discretion. Students may not receive credit for both MA 489X and MA 4895. \nRecommended background: Advanced Linear Algebra and Real Analysis (e.g., MA 2073 Theoretical Linear Algebra and MA 3831 Principles of Real Analysis, or equivalent)", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": -1}
