{"title": "CELL BIOLOGY", "level": "2550", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "Cat. I\nThe goal of this course is to help students to develop a working understanding of the unifying concepts that define cell structure and function including replication, metabolism, regulation, communication and death. Applications in therapeutics, molecular medicine, and genetic engineering will be introduced. Classic and current research examples will provide practice in hypothesis generation and testing as well as making clear the importance of a working knowledge of cell biology to support advances in biotechnology and medicine. The course serves as the foundation of all fields of modern biology, and is recommended for all BBT and other life science majors.\n\nRecommended background: BB 1035 (Biotechnology) or equivalent", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
