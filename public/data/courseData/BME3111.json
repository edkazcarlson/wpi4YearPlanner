{"title": "PHYSIOLOGY AND ENGINEERING", "level": "3111", "abbreviation": "BME", "description": "Cat. I\n This course provides students with an understanding of mammalian physiology \nand the engineering aspects of different physiological systems. The course will \nhave both a lecture and laboratory portion. The laboratory portion will provide \nthe students with the ability to analyze and interpret data from living systems,\n which is a required ABET program criteria for student majoring in Biomedical \nEngineering. The course will focus on a number of organ systems that may \ninclude cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal. Engineering principles that include \nbiomechanical, bioelectrical, and biofluids will be applied to physiological systems.\n \n     Recommended background: A knowledge of biomechanics and biotransport (BME 2511), interactions of cells and biomaterials, (BME 2811), bioelectric foundations (BME 2210) and data acquisition and data analysis (BME 2211) or equivalent.", "req": [[["BME"], ["2511"]], [["BME"], ["2811"]], [["BME"], ["2210"]], [["BME"], ["2211"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
