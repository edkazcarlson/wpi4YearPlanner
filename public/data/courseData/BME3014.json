I (1/6 unit)\nThis course is an introduction to the computational methods used to extract and analyze the signals produced by biomedical phenomena. The goal of this course is to familiarize the student with implementing the most common algorithmic approaches for data analysis used in biomedical engineering. Coursework will cover programming for topics such as peak detection, spectral analysis and the fast Fourier transform FFT method, auto-regression analysis, polynomial trend removal, and signal filtering methods.\nRecommended background: BME 2211, CS1004 or equivalent", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
