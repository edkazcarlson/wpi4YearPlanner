{"title": "CELL CULTURE MODELS FOR TISSUE REGENERATION", "level": "357X", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "Cat I (1/3 unit) \nThis course is an intensive hands-on laboratory that explores mammalian cells as building blocks of complex tissues in vitro. In addition to learning standard cell culture skills, students will have the opportunity to examine cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and function under different culture conditions.  The course culminates with design and development of a cell-based system for an application in regenerative medicine (e.g., wound healing and fibrosis). Students will synthesize and present their work in the form of a research manuscript.\n  Recommended background: a working knowledge of the principles of cell biology (BB 2550 or equivalent) and molecular biology and/or genetics (BB 2920 or 2950 or equivalent) as well as foundational lab experience such as that offered in the BB 2900 lab sequence.\nSome sections of this course may be offered as Writing Intensive (WI)", "req": [[["BB"], ["2550"]], [["BB"], ["2920"]], [["BB"], ["2900"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
