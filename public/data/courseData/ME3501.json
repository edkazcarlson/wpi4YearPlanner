{"title": "ELEMENTARY CONTINUUM MECHANICS", "level": "3501", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "Cat. II\nIn typical mathematics courses, students learn principles and techniques by \nsolving many short and specially prepared problems. They rarely gain experience\n in formulating and solving mathematical equations that apply to real life \nengineering problems. This course will give students this type of applied \nmathematical experience.\n \nThe course emphasizes the application of basic laws of nature as they apply to\n differential elements which lead to differential equations that need to be solved; all of these ideas are used in higher level engineering science courses such as fluid\n mechanics, heat transfer, elasticity, etc. Emphasis will be placed on understanding \nthe physical concepts in a problem, selecting appropriate differential \nelements, developing differential equations, and finding ways to solve these \nequations. Limitations on the mathematical solutions due to assumptions made \nwill be considered.\n \n     Recommended background: Ordinary Differential Equations (MA 2051),\n statics (ES 2501), dynamics (ES 2503).\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
