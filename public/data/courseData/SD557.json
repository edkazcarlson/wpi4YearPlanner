{"title": "LATENT STRUCTURES, UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND POLICY", "level": "557", "abbreviation": "SD", "description": "This course addresses policy resilience and unintended\n consequences arising out of actions that\n are not cognizant of the latent structure causing \nthe problem. An attempt is made to identify the \ngeneric systems describing such latent structures.\n The latent structures discussed include a selection\n from capacity constraining and capacity enabling\n systems, resource allocation, and economic cycles \nof various periodicities. Problems discussed in \nlessons include pests, gang violence, terrorism,\n political instability, professional competence in \norganizations, urban decay, and economic growth\n and recessions. Students work with selected public \npolicy problems relevant to the generic latent\n structures discussed in the course. Pre-requisites: \nSD 550 System Dynamics Foundation: Managing \nComplexity, SD 551 Modeling and Experimental\n Analysis of Complex Problems.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
