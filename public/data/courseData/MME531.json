{"title": "DISCRETE MATHEMATICS", "level": "531", "abbreviation": "MME", "description": "This course deals with concepts and methods \nwhich emphasize the discrete nature in many \nproblems and structures. The rapid growth of this\n branch of mathematics has been inspired by its \nwide range of applicability to diverse fields such as \ncomputer science, management, and biology. The\n essential ingredients of the course are:\nCombinatorics - The Art of Counting.\nTopics include basic counting principles and\n methods such as recurrence relations, generating\n functions, the inclusion-exclusion principle\n and the pigeonhole principle. Applications may\n include block designs, latin squares, finite projective\n planes, coding theory, optimization and \nalgorithmic analysis.\nGraph Theory. This includes direct graphs and \nnetworks. Among the parameters to be examined\n are traversibility, connectivity, planarity, duality\n and colorability.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
