{"title": "APPLIED BAYESIAN STATISTICS", "level": "556", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Bayesian statistics makes use of an inferential\n process that models data summarizing the results \nin terms of probability distributions for the model \nparameters. A key feature is that in the Bayesian\napproach, past information can be updated with \nnew data in an elegant way in order to aid in\ndecision making. Topics included in the courses: \nstatistical decision theory, the Bayesian inferential\n framework (model specification, model fitting and \nmodel checking); computational methods for posterior\n simulation integration; regression models, hierarchical models, and ANOVA; time permitting,\n additional topics will include generalized \nlinear models, multivariate models, missing data\n problems, and time series analysis.
