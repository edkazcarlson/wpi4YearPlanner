{"title": "FIRE DYNAMICS I", "level": "521", "abbreviation": "FP", "description": "This course introduces students to fundamentals of fire and combustion and is intended to serve as the first exposure to fire dynamics phenomena. The course includes fundamental topics in fire and combustion such as thermodynamics of combustion, fire chemistry, premixed and diffusion flames, solid burning, ignition, plumes, heat release rate curves, and flame spread. These topics are then used to develop the basis for introducing compartment fire behavior, pre- and postflashover conditions and zone modeling. Basic computational ability is assumed. Basic numerical methods are used and can be learned during the course via independent study. (Prerequisites: Undergraduate chemistry, thermodynamics or physical chemistry, fluid mechanics and heat transfer.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
