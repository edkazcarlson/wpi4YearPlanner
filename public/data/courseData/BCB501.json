{"title": "BIOINFORMATICS", "level": "501", "abbreviation": "BCB", "description": "This course will provide an overview of bioinformatics, \ncovering a broad selection of the most \nimportant techniques used to analyze biological \nsequence and expression data. Students will acquire \na working knowledge of bioinformatics applications \nthrough hands-on use of software to ask\n and answer biological questions. In addition, the\n course will provide students with an introduction\n to the theory behind some of the most important\nalgorithms used to analyze sequence data (for \nexample, alignment algorithms and the use of hidden\n Markov models). Topics covered will include \nprotein and DNA sequence alignments, evolutionary \nanalysis and phylogenetic trees, obtaining\n protein secondary structure from sequence, and\n analysis of gene expression including clustering \nmethods. Students may not receive credit for both\n BCB 4001 and BCB 501. (Prerequisite: knowledge\nof genetics, molecular biology, and statistics \nat the undergraduate level.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
