{"title": "MICROELECTRONIC CIRCUITS I", "level": "2201", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course is the first of a two-course sequence in electronic circuit design. It\nbegins with a substantive treatment of the fundamental behavior of semiconductor\nmaterials and moves on to the semiconductor diode, the bipolar transistor,\n and the field-effect transistor. Laboratory exercises are provided to reinforce the \ntheory of operation of these devices. Numerous circuit applications are \nconsidered, including: power supplies, transistor amplifiers, and FET switches.\n \nTopics include: the pn junction, diode operation, transducers, rectification, voltage\n regulation, limiting and clamping circuits, transistor operation, biasing, small-signal\n and large-signal models, transistors amplifiers, and switching applications. \nRecommended background: ECE 2019.", "req": [[["ECE"], ["2019"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
