Topics include spectral theory for linear operators \nin n-dimensional and infinite dimensional\nHilbert spaces, spectral theory for symmetric compact \noperatos, linear and bilinear forms, Riesz and\nLax-Milgram theorems, weak derivatives, Sobolev\n spaces H1, H2, Rellich compactness theorem, weak\nand classical solutions for Dirichlet and Neumann\n problems in one variable and in Rn, Dirichlet\nvariational principle, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n Other related topics will be covered at the \ninstructor's discretion.
