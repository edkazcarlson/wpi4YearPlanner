{"title": "SIMULATION IN BIOLOGY", "level": "3010", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "Cat. II\n\nComputer simulations are becoming increasingly important in understanding and predicting the behavior of a wide variety of biological systems, ranging from metastasis of cancer cells, to spread of disease in an epidemic, to management of natural resources such as fisheries and forests. In this course, students will\nlearn to use a graphical programming language to simulate biological systems. Most of the classroom time will be spent working individually or in groups, first learning the language, and then programming simulation projects. We will also discuss several papers on biological simulations from the primary scientific literature. In constructing and comparing their simulations, students will demonstrate for themselves how relatively simple behavioral rules followed by individual molecules, cells, or organisms can result in complex system behaviors.\n\nRecommended background: Students taking this course must have a solid background in a biological area they would like to simulate, at about the depth provided by a BB 3000 level class. No programming experience is assumed.\nThis course will offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["BB"], ["3000"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
