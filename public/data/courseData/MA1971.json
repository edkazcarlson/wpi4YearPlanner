{"title": "BRIDGE TO HIGHER MATHEMATICS", "level": "1971", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Cat. I \nThe principal aim of this course is to introduce and enhance mathematical thinking. The course is intended not only for beginning mathematics, statistics or actuarial students, but also for students seeking to further their mathematical interests and those simply curious about logic and reason. Students in the course will be expected to explain, justify, defend, disprove, conjecture and verify mathematical ideas, both verbally and in writing. One expected by-product of this training is that students will develop concrete proof-writing skills which will improve their prospects for success in more advanced mathematics courses. When appropriate, course discussion will touch on current events in the mathematical sciences, including recently solved problems and open challenges facing today's scientists. \nRecommended background: at least two courses in Mathematical Sciences at WPI, or equivalent.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
