I \nThis course introduces students to the structure and behavior of modern digital\ncomputers and the way they execute programs. Machine organization topics include the Von Neumann model of execution, functional organization of computer hardware, the memory hierarchy, caching performance, and pipelining. Assembly language topics include representations of numbers in computers, basic instruction sets, addressing modes, stacks and procedures, low-level I/O, and the functions of compilers, assemblers, linkers, and loaders. The course also presents how code and data structures of higher-level languages are mapped into the assembly language and machine representations of a modern processor. Programming projects will be carried out in the C language and the assembly language of a modern processor. \nRecommended background: CS 2301 or CS 2303, or a significant knowledge of C/C++.", "req": [[["CS"], ["2301"]], [["CS"], ["2303"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
