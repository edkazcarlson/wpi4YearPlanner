The\n course prepares students to think broadly and concretely\n about network security; it is not designed \nto teach students low-level tools for monitoring \nor maintaining system security. Assignments and\n projects will assess each student\u2019s ability to think \nboth conceptually and practically about network\n security. (Prerequisites: a strong background in \ncomputer networking and systems, either at the\nundergraduate or graduate level, and moderate\n programming experience.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
