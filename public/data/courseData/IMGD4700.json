{"title": "ADVANCED STORYTELLING: QUEST LOGIC AND LEVEL DESIGN", "level": "4700", "abbreviation": "IMGD", "description": "Cat. II\nThis course provides an in-depth examination of storytelling as it is currently\n done in 2D and 3D games through a study of quests and construction of \ngaming spaces. Level designers turn stories into games through building virtual\n spaces and populating them with non-player characters who have their own \nobjectives. Cinematics are used to extend the narrative space. The course \nrequires students to build multiple virtual spaces that have a history and a\n population with present needs. Students need to work out plotting through the \nlogic of a quest, build several areas that supports that logic and create cinematics \nto extend their narrative space. \n     \nRecommended background: IMGD 1002, or equivalent knowledge.\n Students may not receive credit for both IMGD 4700 and IMGD 403X.\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["IMGD"], ["1002"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
