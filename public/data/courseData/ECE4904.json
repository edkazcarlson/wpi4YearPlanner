II\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce students to the physics of semiconductor\n devices and to show how semiconductor devices operate in typical linear\nand nonlinear circuit applications. This material complements the electronics \nsequence of courses and will draw illustrative examples of electronic circuit\n applications from other courses. Topics: carrier transport processes in semiconductor\n materials. Carrier lifetime. Theory of p-n junctions. Bipolar transistors \ninternal theory, dc characteristics, charge control, Ebers-Moll relations; high \nfrequency and switching characteristics, hybrid-pi model; n- and p-channel \nMOSFETS, CMOS.\n \n     Recommended background: ECE 2201. \n     Suggested background: ECE 3204 \n(helpful but not necessary).\n \nStudents may not receive credit for ECE 3901 if they have received credit for \nECE 4904.", "req": [[["ECE"], ["2201"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": -1}
