I\nThe Great Problems Seminars (GPS) are a two course sequence designed to engage Worcester\nPolytechnic Institute's first-year students with current events, societal problems, \nand human needs. Each seminar starts with an important problem and \nintroduces some of the key disciplinary tools that could be used to attack the \nproblem. The focus for most of the second course will be a research\n project related to the GPS theme. Students will present their project work in a \nposter session at the end of the second term. Each seminar is developed and presented\n by an interdisciplinary pair of faculty. To participate, students must enroll in\n the two course sequence. Academic credit for the GPS will depend on the theme \nand the faculty who develop the seminar.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
