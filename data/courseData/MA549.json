{"title": "ANALYSIS OF LIFETIME DATA", "level": "549", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Lifetime data occurs frequently in engineering,\n where it is known as reliability or failure time \ndata, and in the biomedical sciences, where it is \nknown as survival data. This course covers the \nbasic methods for analyzing such data. Topics \ninclude: probability models for lifetime data, censoring, \ngraphical methods of model selection and\n analysis, parametric and distribution-free inference, \nparametric and distribution-free regression\n methods. As time permits, additional topics such \nas frailty models and accelerated life models will\n be considered. Special emphasis will be placed on \nrealistic applications of the theory using statistical\n computer packages. (Prerequisite: knowledge of \nbasic probability and statistics at the level of\n MA 511 is assumed.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
