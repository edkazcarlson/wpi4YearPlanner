"{\"title\": \"BIOMEDICAL ROBOTICS\", \"level\": \"5205\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"This course will provide an overview of a multitude \\nof biomedical applications of robotics. Applications\\ncovered include: image-guided surgery,\\n percutaneous therapy, localization, robot-assisted \\nsurgery, simulation and augmented reality, laboratory\\n and operating room automation, robotic\\n rehabilitation, and socially assistive robots. Specific \\nsubject matter includes: medical imaging, coordinate\\n systems and representations in 3D space, \\nrobot kinematics and control, validation, haptics,\\n teleoperation, registration, calibration, image processing,\\n tracking, and human-robot interaction.\\n Topics will be discussed in lecture format followed\\n by interactive discussion of related literature. The\\n course will culminate in a team project covering \\none or more of the primary course focus areas. \\nRecommended background: Linear algebra, ME/\\nRBE 501 or equivalent.
