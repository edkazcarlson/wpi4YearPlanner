"{\"title\": \"INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS\", \"level\": \"5108\", \"abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"description\": \"The course provides the theory and practice of computational fluid dynamics at an entry graduate level. Topics covered include: classification of partial differential equations (PDEs) in fluid dynamics and characteristics; finite difference schemes on structured grids; temporal discretization schemes; consistency, stability and error analysis of finite difference schemes; explicit and implicit finite differencing schemes for 2D and 3D linear hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic, and non-linear PDEs in fluid dynamics; direct and iterative solution methods for algebraic systems. The course requires completion of several projects using MATLAB.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
