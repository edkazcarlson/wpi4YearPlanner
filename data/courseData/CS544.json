All phases \nof compilation and interpretation are investigated \nin order to give the student an appreciation for the \noverall construction of a compiler. Typical projects \nmay include implementation of a small compiler \nfor a recursive or special-purpose language.\n (Prerequisites: knowledge of several higher-level \nlanguages and at least one assembly language. The \nmaterial in CS 503 is helpful.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
