"{\"title\": \"DESIGN OF TABLETOP STRATEGY GAMES\", \"level\": \"2500\", \"abbreviation\": \"IMGD\", \"description\": \"Cat. II\\nThe objective of the course is to teach students how to design board strategy\\ngames. The design principles are transferable to other types of games, such as \\ncomputer games. Game quality issues such as rules unambiguity, depth,\\ncomplexity, branching width, balance, and historical content are examined.\\n Basic elements and types of game rules, such as map gridding, restricted play \\nchoices, resource limitations, and depths of game economics are discussed.\\n Central to the course is the game design project: students design, playtest, and\\n develop their own game. One two-hour laboratory a week covers play, and\\n playtesting, and supports the game design project.\\n \\n     Recommended background: IMGD 1000\\n.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"req\": [[[\"IMGD\"], [\"1000\"]]], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": \"2016\"}"
