I\n \nA continuation of PH 2301, this course deals with more advanced subjects in\nelectromagnetism, as well as the study of basic subjects with a more advanced level\n of mathematical analysis. Fundamentals of electric and magnetic fields, dielectric\n and magnetic properties of matter, quasi-static time-dependent phenomena, and\n generation and propagation of electromagnetic waves are investigated from the \npoint of view of the classical Maxwell's equations.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
