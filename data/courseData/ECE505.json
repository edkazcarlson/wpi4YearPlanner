Topics \\ninclude CPU structure and function, addressing \\nmodes, instruction formats, memory system \\norganization, memory mapping and hierarchies,\\n concepts of cache and virtual memories, storage\\n systems, standard local buses, high-performance\\nI/O, computer communication, basic principles of \\noperating systems, multiprogramming, multiprocessing, \\npipelining and memory management. The \\narchitecture principles underlying RISC and CISC\\n processors are presented in detail. The course also \\nincludes a number of design projects, including \\nsimulating a target machine, architecture using \\na high-level language (HLL). (Prerequisites: \\nUndergraduate course in logic circuits and microprocessor\\n system design, as well as proficiency \\nin assembly language and a structured high-level\\n language such as C or Pascal.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
