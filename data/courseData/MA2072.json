"{\"title\": \"ACCELERATED MATRICES AND LINEAR ALGEBRA I\", \"level\": \"2072\", \"abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"description\": \"Cat. I \\nThis course provides an accelerated introduction to the theory and techniques of matrix algebra and linear algebra, aimed at Mathematical Sciences majors and others interested in advanced concepts of linear algebra. Topics covered include: matrix algebra, systems of linear equations, linear transformations, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the method of least squares, vector spaces, inner products, non-square matrices and singular value decompositions. Students will be exposed to computational and numerical techniques, and to applications of linear algebra, particularly to Data Science. Credit may not be earned for this course and MA 2071. \\nRecommended background: Basic knowledge of matrix algebra\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
