I\\n \\nPrinciples of Real Analysis is a two-part course giving a rigorous presentation of the important concepts of classical real analysis. Topics covered in the sequence include: basic set theory, elementary topology of Euclidean spaces, metric spaces, compactness, limits and continuity, differentiation, Riemann-Stieltjes integration, infinite series, sequences of functions, and topics in multivariate calculus. Recommended background: at least one course focused on proof-based mathematics (e.g., MA 1971 Bridge to Higher Mathematics, MA1033 Theoretical Calculus III).\", \"req\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"1971\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"1033\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
