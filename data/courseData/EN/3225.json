II This course examines a selection of Shakespeare\\u2019s plays, specifically addressing issues of performance. We will approach the plays through close reading; in relationship to the historical, cultural, and theatrical context in which they were written and originally produced; through viewing and analysis (film and live performance); and as they have been and can be interpreted for performance. We will explore the relationship between text and performance in a practical way with performance exercises and staging scenes from the plays. We will also consider how production elements (design elements including setting and costumes, casting, direction and performance choices, etc.) create and convey meaning and shape audience response. This course will be offered in 2020-21, and in alternating years thereafter.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended background: Some familiarity with Shakespeare and or/theatre but the course is suitable for anyone with interest in the subject.\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2020\"}"
