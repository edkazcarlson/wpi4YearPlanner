"{\"Course Name\": \"AMERICAN AUTHORS\", \"Course Level\": \"3238\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"EN\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II EN faculty with expertise in American literature will select one or more authors to focus on in this course. Examples of such authors are James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Anne Sexton, and August Wilson. These authors often criticize the political and social status quo, addressing inequities in matters of class, gender, race, and sexuality. The intention is for students to focus on such authors in depth, in preparation for their final seminar or practicum. Faculty offering the course will indicate which authors they intend to present on the HUA website well before student signups, to permit efficient program planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended Background: None, though coursework in English (e.g. EN 1251, Introduction to Literature) or any subsequent EN offering will be helpful. This course will be offered in 2020-21, and in alternating years thereafter.\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2020\"}"
