"{\"Course Name\": \"SIMULATION MODELING AND ANALYSIS\", \"Course Level\": \"3460\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"OIE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\r\\n \\r\\nThis course covers the application of simulation to a variety of managerial \\r\\nproblems with examples from operations management, industrial engineering\\r\\n and manufacturing engineering. It introduces the student to the concepts of\\r\\n computer simulation, with an emphasis on the design of a simulation \\r\\nexperiment and statistical interpretation of its results. It will discuss simulation \\r\\nof queueing models, inventory and industrial dynamics, and gaming situations.\\r\\n The role and use of computers for the execution of simulations will also be \\r\\nhighlighted. A commercial simulation language such as Arena will be used to \\r\\nsolve problems from the manufacturing and service industries.\\r\\nRecommended background: CS 1004 and MA 2612.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"1004\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2612\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
