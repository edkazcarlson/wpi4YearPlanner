"{\"Course Name\": \"OPTIMIZATION FOR BUSINESS ANALYTICS\", \"Course Level\": \"559\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"OIE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course covers mathematical optimization beyond the foundational concepts of linear programming. Approaching from the perspective of obtaining globally optimal solutions, a variety of optimization problem classes will be addressed, likely including integer programming, nonlinear programming, and stochastic programming. While ensuring an appropriate level of theory, the emphasis of the course will be on the mathematical modeling and computational solution aspects of such problems that may arise\\u00a0in the finance, healthcare, humanitarian, inventory, nonprofit, operations, production, staffing, and supply chain sectors, among others. (Prerequisite:\\u00a0 OIE 552, equivalent knowledge about optimization and linear programming, or consent of the instructor).\\r\\n\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
