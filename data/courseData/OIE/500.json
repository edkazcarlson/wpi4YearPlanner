"{\"Course Name\": \"ANALYZING AND DESIGNING OPERATIONS TO CREATE VALUE\", \"Course Level\": \"500\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"OIE\", \"Course Description\": \"The operations of an organization focus on the \\ntransformation processes used to produce goods or \\nprovide services. In this course, a variety of statistical\\n and analytical techniques are used to develop\\n deep understanding of process behavior, and to\\n use this analysis to inform process and operational\\n designs. Topics such as measures of dispersion\\nand confidence descriptions, correlation and\\n regression analysis, and time series mathematics\\n will be explored. Operations design is driven by\\n strategic values, and can be critical to developing\\n and sustaining competitive value. Philosophies \\nsuch as lean thinking, as well as technology-based\\n techniques such as optimization and simulation, \\nare explored as a means of developing robust and \\neffective operations.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
