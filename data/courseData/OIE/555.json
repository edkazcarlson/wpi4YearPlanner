"{\"Course Name\": \"LEAN PROCESS DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"555\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"OIE\", \"Course Description\": \"Lean thinking has transformed the way that organizational\\n processes are designed and operated,\\n using a systematic approach that eliminates waste\\n by creating flow dictated by customer pull. In this\\n course we explore the lean concepts of value, flow,\\n demand-pull, and perfection in global, multistage\\n processes. The tactics that are used to translate\\nthese general principles into practice, such as creating\\n manufacturing cells, are also discussed. The \\ndesign process is complicated because in reality\\n not all wastes can be eliminated. To learn effective\\n design, students will practice applying lean ideas \\nin case studies and simulations, exploring how \\nvariability affects process dynamics and combining\\nthis knowledge with analysis of process data.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
