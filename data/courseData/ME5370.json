"{\"title\": \"SURFACE METROLOGY\", \"level\": \"5370\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"This course emphasizes research applications of advanced surface metrology, including the measurement\\n and analysis of surface roughness. Surface \\nmetrology can be important in a wide variety\\nof situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, \\nheat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological\\ngrowth, wear and wetting. These situations impact \\npractically all the engineering disciplines and\\nsciences. The course begins by considering basic \\nprinciples and conventional analyses, and methods.\\nMeasurement and analysis methods are critically \\nreviewed for utility. Students learn advanced \\nmethods for differentiating surface textures that\\n are suspected of being different because of their\\nperformance or manufacture. Students will also \\nlearn methods for making correlations between\\n surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing\\n parameters. The results of applying these methods \\ncan be used to support the design and manufacture\\n of surface textures, and to address issues in\\n quality assurance. Examples of research from a \\nbroad range of applications are presented, including,\\n food science, pavements, friction, adhesion,\\n machining and grinding. Students do a major\\n project of their choosing, which can involve either\\n an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement \\nand analysis. The facilities of WPI\\u2019s Surface \\nMetrology Laboratory are available for making \\nmeasurements for selected projects. Software for\\n advanced analysis methods is also available for use \\nin the course. No previous knowledge of surface \\nmetrology is required. Students should have some \\nbackground in engineering, math or science.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
