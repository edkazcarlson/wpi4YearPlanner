"{\"Course Name\": \"ELECTRON MICROSCOPY\", \"Course Level\": \"509\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MTE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces students to the theory, fundamental operating principles, and specimen preparation techniques of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The primary emphasis is placed on practical SEM, TEM, and x-ray microanalysis of materials. Topics to be covered include basic principles of the electron microscopy; SEM instrumentation, image formation and interpretation, qualitative and quantitative x-ray microanalysis in SEM; electron diffraction and diffraction contrast imaging in TEM. Various application examples of SEM and TEM in materials research will be discussed. Lab work will be included. The course is available to graduate students. Recommended background: CH1020, PH1120, and ES2001. Note: Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics version of the same course.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"1020\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1120\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2001\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
