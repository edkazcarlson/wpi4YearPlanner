"{\"Course Name\": \"PLASTICS\", \"Course Level\": \"558\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MTE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course will provide an integrated overview of the design, selection and use of synthetic plastics. The basic chemistry associated with polymerization and the structure of commercial plastics will be described. Various aspects of polymer crystallization and glass transition will be outlined. Salient aspects of fluid flow and heat transfer during the processing of plastics will be highlighted. Fundamentals of the diverse processing operations used to shape plastics and the resulting structures that develop after processing will be discussed. The mechanical behavior of plastics including elastic deformation, rubber elasticity, yielding, viscoelasticity, fracture and creep will be discussed.  Plastic degradation and environmental issues associated with recycling and disposal of plastics will be examined.  Typical techniques used in the analysis and testing of plastics will be described and a working knowledge of various terminologies used in commercial practice will be provided. Note: Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics version of the same course (MTE594A).\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
