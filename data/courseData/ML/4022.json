"{\"Course Name\": \"LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT II\", \"Course Level\": \"4022\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ML\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I (1/6 unit)\\n \\nThis Course focuses on completing the transition from cadet to lieutenant. As \\nan expansion of the Ethics instruction in ML 3021, the course starts with an \\nexamination of unit ethical climate and the commander's role as the moral\\n anchor of the unit. This is followed by a module addressing military law and \\nleadership. The next module reinforces previous instruction on the organization \\nof the Army and introduces how the Army organizes for operations from the \\ntactical to strategic level. This is followed by instruction on administrative and \\nlogistical management that focuses on the fundamentals of soldier and unit level support. Next is a short module that focuses on preparing cadets for their \\nforthcoming commissioning and military service. At the core of this semester is the Advanced Course's Capstone Exercise. This twelve-lesson exercise directly \\nreinforces all modules from this term, and also incorporates and reinforces many\\nlearning objectives from modules throughout the entire curriculum. The \\nCapstone Exercise requires cadets, both individually and collectively, to apply\\n their knowledge to solve problems and confront situations commonly faced by \\njunior officers. Upon completion of this course the cadets will be prepared to \\nshoulder the responsibility of being a commissioned officer in the United States \\nArmy. Participation in weekly training leadership laboratories; off campus \\ntraining sessions (field training exercises, Military Staff Ride and other special\\n events is required).\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
