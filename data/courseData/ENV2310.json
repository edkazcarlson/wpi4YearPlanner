{"title": "ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND INNOVATION", "level": "2310", "abbreviation": "ENV", "description": "With global attention dominated by environmental catastrophe and despair, we will spotlight new work that has brought together scientists, environmentalists, engineers, and artists to tackle the most serious problems facing communities. We will explore the political ecology implications of control over essential resources and the positive consequences of rethinking and democratizing basic social needs for a more sustainable future. Recent exciting case studies will feature examples of simple solutions that inspire elegant, transferrable, and inexpensive applications of technological design. We will examine the role and obligation that scientists have to collaborate with interdisciplinary and public policy efforts that benefit people with sustainable approaches to architecture, food, energy, transportation, and infrastructure. \n  Recommended background: introductory environmental studies course. \n  Students may not receive credit for both ENV230X and ENV2310.", "req": [[["ENV"], ["230X"]], [["ENV"], ["2310"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
