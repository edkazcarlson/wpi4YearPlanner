"{\"title\": \"LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT I\", \"level\": \"4011\", \"abbreviation\": \"ML\", \"description\": \"Cat. I (1/6 unit)\\n \\nML 4011 begins with a series of lessons designed to enable the cadets to make \\ninformed career decisions as they prepare their accessions documents. Lessons\\nconcentrate on Army operations and training management, communications\\n and leadership skills and support the beginning of the final transition from cadet \\nto lieutenant. The course focuses cadets, early in the year, on attaining\\n knowledge and proficiency in several critical areas they will need to operate \\neffectively as Army officers. These areas include: the Army's training management\\n system, coordinating activities with staffs, and counseling skills. While the \\nproficiency attained in each of these areas will initially be at the apprentice level,\\n cadets will continue to sharpen these skills as they perform their roles as cadet \\nofficers in the ROTC battalion and as new lieutenants after commissioning. At \\nthe end of this semester cadets should possess the fundamental skills, attributes,\\n and abilities to operate as competent leaders in the cadet battalion and \\nconfidently shoulder the responsibilities entrusted to them. Participation in\\n weekly training leadership laboratories; off campus training sessions (field\\n training exercises) and other special events is required.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
