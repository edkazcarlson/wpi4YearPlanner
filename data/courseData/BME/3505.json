"{\"Course Name\": \"SOLID BIOMECHANICS LABORATORY: TECHNIQUES\", \"Course Level\": \"3505\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I (1/6 units)\\nThis laboratory-driven solid biomechanics course provides hands-on experience in\\ncharacterizing the mechanical properties of biological tissues such as bone, tendons, ligaments, skin, and blood vessels and their synthetic analogs. Students gain an in-depth understanding of the course material by performing uniaxial tension and compression, bending, and torsion tests on hard and soft tissues using industry-standard testing equipment and completing mechanical and statistical analysis of the data.\\n     Recommended background: A solid knowledge of mechanics of materials (ES2502) and material science (ES 2001). \\nStudents who have previously received credit for BME3504 cannot receive credit for this course.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"2502\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2001\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"3504\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
