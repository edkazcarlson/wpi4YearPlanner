"{\"Course Name\": \"TRANSPORT ANALYSIS IN BIOENGINEERING\", \"Course Level\": \"361X\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"This course provides an overview of the modeling and analysis of fluid and mass transport processes related to the field of Biomedical Engineering.  Fundamentals and applications of hydrostatics, conservation of mass and momentum in modeling and analysis of biological fluid transport processes in the human body are discussed.  It includes modeling and analysis of blood and biological fluid flow through blood vessels, capillary beds and bioprocess equipment.  Modeling and analysis of diffusive and convective mass transport in biological conduits and membranes, selective permeability and nutrient/waste exchange in parenchymal tissues with transport barriers unique to biological systems such as intact and fenestrated endothelium.  Basic concepts of pharmacokinetics such as plasma clearance, volume of distribution of drugs and other biological solutes in body tissues are also covered.  Surface adsorption and membrane permeability concepts are covered in the context of ligand-receptor interaction kinetics and passive and active transport, respectively.\\n  Recommended background: Basic knowledge of differential and integral calculus (e.g., MA 2051 or equivalent), fundamental knowledge of biological system function or cell function (e.g., BB 1035 or BB 2550 or equivalent), fundamentals of data analysis and programming (e.g., BME 2211) and fundamentals of mathematical modeling techniques applied to biological systems (e.g., BME 2511 or BME 2811, or equivalent).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"1035\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"2211\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"2511\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"2811\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
