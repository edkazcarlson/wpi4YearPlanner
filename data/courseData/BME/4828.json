"{\"Course Name\": \"BIOMATERIAL - TISSUE INTERACTIONS\", \"Course Level\": \"4828\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThis course examines the principles of materials \\nscience and cell biology underlying the design of \\nmedical devices, artificial organs, and scaffolds for\\n tissue engineering. Molecular and cellular interactions \\nwith biomaterials are analyzed in terms\\n of cellular processes such as matrix synthesis,\\n degradation, and contraction. Principles of wound \\nhealing and tissue remodeling are used to study\\n biological responses to implanted materials and\\n devices. Case studies will be analyzed to compare \\ntissue responses to intact, bioresorbable and\\n bioerodible biomaterials. Additionally, this course \\nwill examine criteria for restoring physiological\\n function of tissue and organs, and investigate \\nstrategies to design implants and prostheses based\\n on control of biomaterial-tissue interactions. \\nRecommended Background: \\nBB 2550 or equivalent, ES 2001 or equivalent, PH 1110 or PH 1111.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
