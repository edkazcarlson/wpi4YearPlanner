"{\"Course Name\": \"BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL ANAYLSIS\", \"Course Level\": \"4011\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nIntroduction to biomedical signal processing\\n and analysis. Fundamental techniques to analyze\\n and process signals that originate from biological \\nsources: ECGs, EMGs, EEGs, blood pressure \\nsignals, etc. Course integrates physiological \\nknowledge with the information useful for physiologic \\ninvestigation and medical diagnosis and \\nprocessing. Biomedical signal characterization,\\n time domain analysis techniques (transfer functions, \\nconvolution, auto- and cross-correlation),\\n frequency domain (Fourier analysis), continuous\\n and discrete signals, deterministic and stochastic\\n signal analysis methods. Analog and digital filtering.\\n \\n     Recommended background: ECE 2311,\\n ECE 2312, or equivalent.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17 and in alternating years thereafter\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ECE\"], [\"2311\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2312\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
