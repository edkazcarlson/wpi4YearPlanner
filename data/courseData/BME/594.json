"{\"Course Name\": \"BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL CLUB\", \"Course Level\": \"594\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"(1 credit) \\nThis course will cover different topics in biomedical engineering research, both basic and translational. Enrolled students read and discuss the literature in relevant topics, which may include biomaterials, drug delivery, tissue engineering, cardiovascular engineering, mechanobiology, quantitative imaging, instrumentation, computational biomechanics, injury and rehabilitative biomechanics, or any focused topic related to biomedical engineering. The objectives of the course are for students to learn about current topics within a focused area of biomedical engineering, to improve their ability to critically review literature, and develop their technical presentation skills. Multiple sections of biomedical engineering journal club focused on different research topics may be offered each semester. (Pre-requisite: Master\\u2019s or Ph.D. student in biomedical engineering or a related discipline). \\nBiomedical engineering graduate students may take up to 3 credits of BME 594 to satisfy Biomedical Engineering or Elective course credit to meet graduate program distribution requirements. \\nNOTE: This course cannot be used to satisfy Biomedical Engineering or Engineering elective credit to meet undergraduate program distribution requirements.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
