"{\"Course Name\": \"BIOTRANSPORT LABORATORY\", \"Course Level\": \"3605\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I (1/6 unit) \\n\\nThis laboratory-driven transport course provides hands-on experience in \\nmeasuring heat, flow, and transport in biologically-relevant systems. Students\\n gain an in-depth understanding of the course material from personal observations\\n and measurements on model cardiovascular systems and connective tissues.\\n Challenge-based laboratory projects will be assigned which will require the \\nstudents to determine and execute effective test methods at their own pace in a \\nteam setting and communicate their findings effectively. Systems modeled may\\ninclude blood vessels, stenotic vessels, and aneurysms. Connective tissues tested\\nmay include blood vessels and skin. \\nRecommended background: Heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and transport (BME 2511 and ES 3002, ES 3003, or ES 3004 or equivalent).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BME\"], [\"2511\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3002\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3003\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3004\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
