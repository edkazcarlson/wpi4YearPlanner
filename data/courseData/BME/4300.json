"{\"Course Name\": \"MQP CAPSTONE DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"4300\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I (1/6 unit) \\nThis course guides students through the engineering design process during the first term of their MQP to aid them in fulfilling their capstone design requirement. The course focuses on developing a revised client statement based on the objectives, constraints, and functions of the design. Methods for concept generation, concept selection and development strategy will be covered. In addition, project planning tools, business plans, ethics, and design for manufacturability and sustainability will be covered. \\nRecommended background: Principles of engineering design such as BME 3300 or equivalent. Course should be taken concurrently with the MQP. Students who have taken BME 430X cannot get credit for BME 4300. BME 4300 cannot be used to fulfill graduate degree requirements.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BME\"], [\"3300\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"430X\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"4300\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"4300\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
