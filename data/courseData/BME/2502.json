"{\"Course Name\": \"INTRODUCTION TO BIOMECHANICS: STRESS ANALYSIS\", \"Course Level\": \"2502\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I This is an introductory course that addresses the analysis of basic mechanical and structural elements relevant to biomechanics. Topics include general concepts of stresses, strains, and material properties of biomaterials and biological materials including viscoelasticity. Also covered are stress concentrations, two-dimensional stress transformations, principal stresses, and Mohr\\u2019s circle. Applications are to uniaxially loaded bars, circular shafts under torsion, bending and shearing and deflection of beams. Both statically determinate and indeterminate problems are analyzed.\\u00a0Recommended background: Differential (MA 1021) and integral (MA 1022) calculus, vector algebra (MA 1023), physics mechanics (PH 1110 or PH 1111), and statics (ES 2501). Students who have previously received credit for BME 2511 or ES 2502 may not receive credit for BME 2502.\\r\\n\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"1021\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"1022\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"1023\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1110\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1111\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"2511\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2502\"]], [[\"BME\"], [\"2502\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
