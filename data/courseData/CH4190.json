I\\n \\nThrough lectures, problem sets, reading and discussion, and presentations this course will help elucidate for students the processes that allow regulated gene expression, mechanisms used in each type of regulation, and methods and techniques used for investigation of regulatory mechanisms. Readings from the current original research literature will explore the growing use of model systems and \\\"omic\\\" level approaches to enhance our ever expanding understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms. The development of cell-based therapeutics and genetic engineering as they relate to gene regulation will be introduced. \\nRecommended background: a working knowledge of concepts in biochemistry and molecular genetics  (CH 4110, CH 4120, CH 4130 and BB 4010 or equivalent)\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"4110\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"4120\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"4130\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"4010\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
