Topics include finite automata \nand regular languages, pushdown automata and\n context-free languages, Turing machines and decidability,\nand an introduction to computational\n complexity. (Prerequisite: an undergraduate course \nin discrete mathematics.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
