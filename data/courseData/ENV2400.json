{"title": "ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR", "level": "2400", "abbreviation": "ENV", "description": "Cat. II\nThis course examines how people think about and behave toward the \nenvironment. Environmental problems can ultimately be attributed to the\n environmental decisions and actions of human beings. These behaviors can in \nturn be understood as resulting from the nature and limitations of the human \nmind and the social context in which behavior takes place. Knowledge of the \nroot causes of environmentally harmful behavior is essential for designing\n effective solutions to environmental problems. The goals of the course are (1) to \nprovide students with the basic social science knowledge needed to understand \nand evaluate the behavioral aspects of such important environmental problems as air and water pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, preserving \nbiological diversity, and hazardous waste and (2) to help students identify and\nimprove shortcomings in their knowledge and decisions related to the \nenvironment. Topics will include, but not be limited to: environmental\n problems as \"tragedies of the commons\"; public understanding of global\n warming and global climate modeling; folk biology; risk perception; intelligent \ncriticism of environmental claims; making effective environmental choices;\nstrategies for promoting pro-environmental behavior; and human ability to \nmodel and manage the global environmental future. \n \n     Recommended background: ENV 1100. \n     Suggested background: PSY 1400, PSY 1401, or PSY 1402. \n     Students may not receive credit for both PSY 2405 and ENV 2400. \nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["ENV"], ["1100"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
