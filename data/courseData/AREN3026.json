I\\nThe course presents the basic principles of building envelope design, focusing primarily on its functional performance requirements and practical constructability aspects. Various building envelope systems are discussed and analyzed through case studies. Lecture topics include fa\\u00e7ade and roofing systems made of masonry, stone, concrete, timber, glass, and various metals. In addition, more complex building envelope strategies such as double skin facades, passive solar design, and building automation approaches, are discussed. The course includes design exercises and a case study project.\\n     Recommended background: architectural engineering systems and architectural drafting (AREN 2023, AREN 3001 or equivalent)\", \"req\": [[[\"AREN\"], [\"2023\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"3001\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
