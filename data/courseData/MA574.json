This \ncourse is devoted to the use of mathematical\n optimization and statistics to allocate assets, to\n construct and manage portfolios and to measure\n and manage the resulting risks. The fist part of the\n course covers Markowitz\u2019s mean-variance optimization\n and efficient frontiers, Sharpe\u2019s single index\n and capital asset pricing models, arbitrage pricing \ntheory, structural and statistical multi-factor models,\n risk allocation and risk budgeting. The second \npart of the course is devoted to the intertwining\n of optimization and statistical methodologies in\n modern portfolio management, including resampled \nefficiency, robust and Bayesian statistical\n methods, the Black-Litterman model and robust\n portfolio optimization.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
