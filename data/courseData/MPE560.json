{"title": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS IN PHYSICS", "level": "560", "abbreviation": "MPE", "description": "Hands-on methods of physically testing concepts \nand models of the universe. Technology is utilized\nbut general methods accessible to barely outfitted \nlab environments are stressed. Topics covered are \nin a series of subject units, the physical principles\n underlying the phenomena to be observed and the\nbasis for the measurement techniques employed\n is reviewed. Principles and uses of standard\nlaboratory instruments (oscilloscopes, meters for\n frequency, time, electrical and other quantities, \nlock-in amplifiers, etc.) are stressed. In addition \nto systematic measurement procedures and data\n recording, strong emphasis is placed on processing\n of the data, preparation and interpretation of\n graphical presentations, and analysis of precision\n and accuracy, including determination and \ninterpretation of best value, measures of error and\n uncertainty, linear best fit to data, and identification\n of systematic and random errors. Preparation\n of high-quality experiment reports is also\n emphasized. Representative experiment subjects \nare: mechanical motions and vibrations; free and\n driven electrical oscillations; electric fields and\n potential; magnetic materials and fields; electron\n beam dynamics; optics; diffraction-grating \nspectroscopy; radioactive decay and nuclear energy \nmeasurements.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
