"{\"Course Name\": \"FOUNDATION ENGINEERING\", \"Course Level\": \"3044\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nFoundation engineering is a study of the applications of the principles of soil\\nmechanics and structural theory to the analysis, design and construction of\\n foundations for engineering works with the emphasis on the soil engineering \\naspects of soil structure interaction. Subsurface exploration techniques, design of \\nrigid and flexible retaining structures, and design of, shallow and deep \\nfoundations are considered. Although the course deals mainly with aspects of the\\n design of buildings and bridges, certain parts of the course (design of temporary \\ntrench bracing, for example) are very relevant to construction engineering. \\nRecommended background: CE 3041. \\nSuggested background: CE 3008.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and alternating years therefter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CE\"], [\"3041\"]], [[\"CE\"], [\"3008\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
