"{\"Course Name\": \"TRANSPORTATION: INFRASTRUCTURE MATERIALS LABORATORY\", \"Course Level\": \"4054\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis laboratory-based course introduces standard laboratory soil and asphalt\\nmaterials testing procedures, and effect of physical properties on performance of\\n soils and asphalt pavements. The tests which are performed include: grain size \\nanalysis, Atterberg limits, specific gravity, permeability, compaction, compression \\nand consolidation, and triaxial shear for soils, and penetration, consensus\\n and source properties of aggregate, compaction, resilient modulus, indirect\\n tensile strength and nondestructive testing of soils and hot mix asphalt. \\nInstruction is provided through lecture, laboratory work and field trip.\\n \\n     Recommended background: CE 3041 and CE 3052.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CE\"], [\"3041\"]], [[\"CE\"], [\"3052\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
