"{\"Course Name\": \"Surface Water Quality Modeling\", \"Course Level\": \"565\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course provides a quantitative analysis of\\nthe fate and transport of contaminants in surface\\nwater systems. Water quality models are developed\\nusing a mass balance approach to describe the\\ntransport, dispersal, and chemical/biological reactions\\nof substances introduced into river and lake\\nsystems. Topics covered include water quality standards,\\nmodel formulation and application, waste\\nload allocation, and water quality parameters such\\nas biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen,\\nnutrients, and toxic chemicals.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
