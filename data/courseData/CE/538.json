"{\"Course Name\": \"PAVEMENT ANALYSIS AND DESIGN FOR HIGHWAYS AND AIRPORTS\", \"Course Level\": \"538\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course is designed for civil engineers and will\\n provide a detailed survey of analysis and design \\nconcepts for flexible and rigid pavements for \\nhighways and airports. The materials will cover \\nelastic and inelastic theories of stress pavement \\ncomponents and currently used design methods,\\n i.e., Corps of Engineers, AASHTO, etc. The use \\nof finite element methods for pavement stress and\\n deformation analysis will be presented. A review \\nof pavement rehabilitation methods and processes \\nwill be presented. (Prerequisites: differential\\n equations, construction materials, soil mechanics, \\ncomputer literacy.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
