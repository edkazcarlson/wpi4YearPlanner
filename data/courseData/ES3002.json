{"title": "MASS TRANSFER", "level": "3002", "abbreviation": "ES", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course introduces the student to the phenomena of diffusion and mass\ntransfer. These occur in processes during which a change in chemical composition \nof one or more phases occurs. Diffusion and mass transfer can take place in \nliving systems, in the environment, and in chemical processes. This course will\n show how to handle quantitative calculations involving diffusion and/or mass \ntransfer, including design of process equipment.\n Topics may include: fundamentals of diffusional transport, diffusion in thin \nfilms; unsteady diffusion; diffusion in solids; convective mass transfer; \ndispersion; transport in membranes; diffusion with chemical reaction;\n simultaneous heat and mass transfer; selected mass transfer operations such as\n absorption, drying, humidification, extraction, crystallization, adsorption, etc. \nRecommended background: fundamentals of chemical thermodynamics, fluid\nflow and heat transfer; ordinary differential equations (MA 2051 or equivalent).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
