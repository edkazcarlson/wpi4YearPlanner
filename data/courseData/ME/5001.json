"{\"Course Name\": \"APPLIED NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING\", \"Course Level\": \"5001\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"A study of important numerical and computational \\nmethods for solving engineering science \\nproblems. The course will include methods for \\nsolving linear and nonlinear equations, interpolation \\nstrategies, evaluating integrals, and solving \\nordinary and partial differential equations. Finite\\n difference methods will be developed in full for \\nthe solution of partial differential equations. The\\n course materials emphasize the systematic generation \\nof numerical methods for elliptic, parabolic, \\nand hyperbolic problems, and the analysis of their\\n stability, accuracy, and convergence properties.\\n The student will be required to write and run\\n computer programs. Students cannot receive credit\\n for this course if they have taken the Special Topics \\n(ME 593M) version of the same course or ME 515.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
