"{\"Course Name\": \"RADIATION HEAT TRANSFER APPLICATION AND DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"442X\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"Radiation Heat Transfer Applications will develop the student\\u2019s knowledge of radiation and multi-mode heat transfer.  Fundamentals of radiation will be covered: radiative properties of surfaces; view factors; exchange between black and grey surfaces; emission and absorption of gases; and flame radiation.  Use of numerical methods will be emphasized as appropriate for solution of applications: the select numerical methods (numerical integration, matrix methods, ODE solutions) can be learned during the course.  The course will conclude with a design exercise to be completed by each student.  Each exercise will highlight radiation in a realistic scenario that requires multi-mode heat transfer and fluid mechanics analysis to develop the design solution.  Exercise topics will come from subjects such as: solar power plants, solar effects on buildings, furnaces, fire safety in the built environment, etc.\\n     Recommended background: differential and integral calculus, and ordinary differential equations (MA 2051 or equivalent), and thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer (ES 3001, 3003, 3004 or equivalents).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3001\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
