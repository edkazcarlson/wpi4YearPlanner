"{\"Course Name\": \"COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN AND GEOMETRIC MODELING\", \"Course Level\": \"5401\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"This course covers topics in computer-aided\\n geometric design and applications in mechanical\\nengineering. The objectives of the course are to \\nfamiliarize the students with complex geometric\\nmodeling and analytical techniques used in \\ncontemporary computer-aided design systems.\\n Topics to be covered may include complex curve\\n and surface generation, solid modeling, assembly \\nand mechanism modeling, transformations,\\n analytic geometry, offsets and intersections of \\ncomplex shapes, graphics standards and data \\ntransfer, rendering techniques, parametric design and geometric optimization, numerical methods \\nfor geometric analysis and graphics design programming. Prerequisites: calculus, linear algebra, \\nintroductory computer programming, and ability \\nto utilize a solid modeling CAD system. Students \\ncannot receive credit for this course if they have taken \\nthe Special Topics (ME 593C) version of the same\\n course or ME 545.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
