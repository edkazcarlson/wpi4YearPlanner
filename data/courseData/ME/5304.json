"{\"Course Name\": \"LASER METROLOGY AND NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING\", \"Course Level\": \"5304\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"Demands for increased performance and efficiency \\nof components in the nano/micro-, meso-, and\\nmacro-scales, impose challenges to their engineering\\n design, study, and optimization. These\\nchallenges are compounded by multidisciplinary\\n applications to be developed inexpensively in short\\ntime while satisfying stringent design objectives. \\nAs a consequence, effective quantitative engineering\\nmethodologies, such as optical techniques, are\\n frequently used in the study and optimization of\\nadvanced components and systems. In this course,\\n modern laser metrology techniques are discussed\\nand their practical applications to solve problems,\\n with emphasis on nondestructive testing (NDT), \\nare illustrated with laboratory demonstrations. \\nTopics covered include wave and Fourier optics, \\nclassic and holographic interferometry, speckle \\ntechniques, solid-state lasers, fiber optics, CCD \\ncameras, computer vision, camera calibration \\nmethods, and image processing and data reduction\\n algorithms as required in quantitative fringe\\n analysis. Detail examples of nondestructive testing\\n and coherent optical metrology in solid mechanics,\\n vibrations, heat transfer, electromagnetics,\\n and reverse engineering are given. Students are\\n required to work on projects depending on their\\n background and interests. Recommended background: \\nmechanics, materials, physics, knowledge \\nof a high-level computer programming language.\\n Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics (ME 593J) version of \\nthe same course or ME 534.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ME\"], []], [[\"ME\"], []]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
