"{\"Course Name\": \"INTRODUCTION TO PLASMA DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"5110\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"The course introduces concepts of partially ionized gases (plasmas) and their role\\nin a wide range of science and engineering fields. Fundamental theory includes topics in: equilibrium of ionized gases and kinetic theory; motion of charged particles in electromagnetic fields; elastic and inelastic collisions, cross sections and\\ntransport processes; fluid theory and magnetohydrodynamic models; sheaths. Applications cover areas such as plasma diagnostics, plasma discharges, acecraft/environment interactions, and plasma-aided material processing.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
