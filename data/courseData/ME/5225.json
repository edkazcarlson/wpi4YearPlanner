"{\"Course Name\": \"FIBER OPTICAL SENSORS\", \"Course Level\": \"5225\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"This course is designed to introduce students to the field of fiber optics, with an emphasis on design and working principles of fiber optical sensors for mechanical, biological, and chemical measurements. It covers basic knowledge and working principles of optical fibers and fiber optical components, as well as practical design guidelines and applications of fiber optical sensing systems. The first half of the course will introduce different aspects of fiber optics, including working principles of optical fibers, single-mode and multimode fibers, properties of optical fibers, passive fiber optical devices, light sources, and optical detectors. The second half of the course will focus on various fiber optical sensors and sensing systems, including working principles of fiber optical sensors, intensity-based and interferometer-based fiber optical sensors, fiber Bragg gratings, low-coherence fiber optical interferometers. Specifically, design and implementation of fiber optical sensors and sensing systems for strain and pressure measurements will be discussed in detail. Measurement characteristics and signal processing of fiber optical sensing systems for different applications will be introduced. \\nRecommended Background: ES2502, PH1140.
