"{\"Course Name\": \"THE TECHNOLOGY OF ALPINE SKIING\", \"Course Level\": \"1520\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis course explores science and engineering issues associated with equipment and technique for alpine skiing, particularly racing. A diverse group of technical subjects related to engineering mechanics are discussed: tribology, beams, rigid body motion, material science, machining and biomechanics. Specifically we will examine: ski-snow interactions, technique for gliding, turning and stepping, selection of line in racing; equipment design, testing and performance; and ski injuries. We will also address issues in the epidemiology of skiing injuries, the calculation of the cost of ski injuries to society, the impact of ski equipment technology on litigation and the impact of litigation on equipment and trail design.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
