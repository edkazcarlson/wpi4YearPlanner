"{\"Course Name\": \"DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF THERMAL SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"4422\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces students to design of small and large scale optimal thermal systems.  The hardware associated with thermal systems includes fans, pumps, compressors, engines, expanders, turbines, heat and mass exchangers, and reactors, all interconnected with some form of conduits.  Generally, the working substances are fluids.  These types of systems appear in such industries as power generation, electric and gas utilities, refrigeration and cryogenics, air conditioning and heating, food, chemical, petroleum, and other process industries.\\n     This course is intended for mechanical engineering students, especially those seeking a concentration in Thermal-Fluids.  Additionally, this course might be of interest to students in Aerospace Engineering and Chemical Engineering. \\n     Recommended Background: Knowledge in thermodynamics (ES 3001), fluid mechanics (ES 3004), heat transfer (ES 3003), and introduction to design (ME 2300)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
