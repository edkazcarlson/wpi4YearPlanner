"{\"Course Name\": \"MATERIALS PROCESSING\", \"Course Level\": \"2820\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nAn introduction to material processing in manufacturing. This course provides \\nimportant background for anyone interested in manufacturing, design \\nengineering design, sales, or management.\\n \\nProcessing of polymers, ceramics, metals and composites is discussed. Processes \\ncovered include: rolling, injection molding, forging, powder metallurgy, joining\\n and machining. The relationships between materials, processes, processing \\nparameters and the properties of manufactured parts are developed. During the \\ncourse the students should develop the ability to choose materials, processes, and\\nprocessing parameters for designing manufacturing procedures to take a \\nprototype part to production. \\n\\nRecommended background: ME 1800 Materials Selection and Manufacturing\\nProcesses, and ES 2001 Introduction to Materials Science.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ME\"], [\"1800\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2001\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
