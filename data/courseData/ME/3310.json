"{\"Course Name\": \"KINEMATICS OF MECHANISMS\", \"Course Level\": \"3310\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nAn introduction to the synthesis and analysis of linkages, cams and gear trains is\\npresented. The design process is introduced and used to solve unstructured \\ndesign problems in linkage and cam design. Algebraic and graphical techniques\\n to analyze the displacement, velocity and acceleration of linkages and cams are \\ndeveloped. Computer programs for the design and analysis of linkages are used \\nby students. Results of student design projects are presented in professional\\n engineering reports.\\n \\nRecommended background: Ordinary Differential Equations (MA 2051), \\nstatics (ES 2501), dynamics (ES 2503).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2503\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
