"{\"Course Name\": \"DYNAMICS OF MECHANISMS AND MACHINES\", \"Course Level\": \"3311\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis course provides an in-depth study of forces in dynamic systems. Dynamic \\nforce analysis is developed using matrix methods. Computer programs are used \\nto solve the sets of simultaneous equations derived by students for realistic,\\n unstructured design problems. Inertial and shaking forces, elementary \\nmechanical vibrations, torque-time functions, rotational and reciprocating \\nbalance and cam dynamics are covered using the internal combustion engine as a\\n design example. Students execute unstructured design projects and prepare\\n professional engineering reports on the results. Computers are used extensively \\nto solve the dynamic equations. \\nRecommended background: Ordinary Differential Equations (MA 2051), \\nstatics (ES 2501), dynamics (ES 2503), kinematics (ME 3310), linear algebra.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2503\"]], [[\"ME\"], [\"3310\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
