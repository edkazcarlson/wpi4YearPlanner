"{\"Course Name\": \"ADVANCED DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"5202\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"Basic concepts and general principles of classical\\n kinematics and dynamics of particles, systems of\\nparticles and rigid bodies are presented with application \\nto engineering problems with complicated\\n three-dimensional kinematics and dynamics. Derivation \\nof the governing equations of motion using \\nPrinciple of Virtual Work and Lagrange equations \\nis described together with the direct Newton approach.\\nApplications include: swings-effect and its\\n use in engineering, illustrating in particular limit\\n cycles and their stability and reversed-swings control\\n of vibrations of pendulum; various examples \\nof gyroscopic effects; and especially introductory\\n rotordynamics including transverse vibrations \\n(whirling) and potential instability of rotating\\n shafts. Students cannot receive credit for this course \\nif they have taken the Special Topics (ME 593D)\\n version of the same course or ME 527.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
