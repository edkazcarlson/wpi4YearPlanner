"{\"Course Name\": \"ADVANCED DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"4505\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"Course Description\": \"This course provides natural continuation of the course ES 2503 (Introduction to Dynamic Systems). The main extension is advanced three-dimensional kinematics and dynamics, with illustrations of application to engineering problems. In particular a variety of inherently 3D phenomena is described whereby a rigid body rotates around an axis, which itself may rotate (gyroscopic effects). A set of new topics includes, among others, Introduction into Rotordynamics (bringing in concept of critical rotation speed); swings-effect and its use in engineering with computer-based miniproject; and brief introduction to stability analysis.\\n\\tWhile the main part of the course is based on direct use of the Newton\\u2019s Laws, a brief introduction into Analytical Mechanics is presented as an alternative approach to Dynamics. The corresponding part of the course includes principle of virtual work and Lagrange equations.\\n     Recommended background:  Introduction to Dynamic Systems (ES-2503)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
