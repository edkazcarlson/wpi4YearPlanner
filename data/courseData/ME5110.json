{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO PLASMA DYNAMICS", "level": "5110", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "The course introduces concepts of partially ionized gases (plasmas) and their role\nin a wide range of science and engineering fields. Fundamental theory includes topics in: equilibrium of ionized gases and kinetic theory; motion of charged particles in electromagnetic fields; elastic and inelastic collisions, cross sections and\ntransport processes; fluid theory and magnetohydrodynamic models; sheaths. Applications cover areas such as plasma diagnostics, plasma discharges, acecraft/environment interactions, and plasma-aided material processing.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
