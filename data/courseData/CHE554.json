"{\"title\": \"MOLECULAR MODELING\", \"level\": \"554\", \"abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"description\": \"This course trains students in the area of molecular\\n modeling using a variety of quantum mechanical\\n and force field methods. The approach will be\\n toward practical applications, for researchers who \\nwant to answer specific questions about molecular\\n geometry, transition states, reaction paths and\\n photoexcited states. No experience in programming is necessary; however, a backround at the \\nintroductory level in quantum mechanics is highly \\ndesirable. Methods to be explored include density \\nfunctional theory, ab initio methods, semiempirical\\n molecular orbital theory, and visualization\\n software for the graphical display of molecules.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
