{"title": "MEMBRANE BIOPHYSICS", "level": "541", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "This course will focus on different areas of \nbiophysics with special emphasis on membrane\nphenomena. The biomedical-biological importance\n of biophysical phenomena will be stressed.\n The course will begin with an introduction to\n the molecular forces relevant in biological media \nand subsequently develop the following topics:\n membrane structure and function; channels, carriers\n and pumps; nerve excitation and related topics;\n and molecular biophysics of motility. Topics will\n be developed assuming a good understanding of\n protein and lipid chemistry, enzyme kinetics, cell \nbiology, and electricity.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
