"{\"title\": \"METABOLISM AND DISEASE\", \"level\": \"4140\", \"abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"description\": \"This course presents a thorough analysis of the most relevant metabolic processes in cells. The catabolism of sugars and lipids will be presented in the context of energy generation and storage. Nucleotide and amino acid metabolism will discussed as building blocks for large biomolecules. Throughout the course the links between metabolism, hereditary pathologies, as well as risk of metabolic imbalances such as diabetes and obesity will be presented.\\n  Recommended background: Familiarity with organic chemistry topics including functional groups, nucleophilic addition and substitution reactions, stereochemistry, and carbonyl chemistry. General knowledge of cellular architecture is also recommended. See CH 2310, CH 2320, CH 2330, and BB2550 or equivalent.\\n  Specific concepts that we will discuss are:  Glucose and glycogen metabolism; Gluconeogenesis; Citric Acid Cycle; Lipid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms; Mammalian Fuel Metabolism: Integration and Regulation.\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"2310\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2320\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2330\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
