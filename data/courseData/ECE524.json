"{\"title\": \"ADVANCED ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN\", \"level\": \"524\", \"abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"description\": \"This course is an advanced introduction to the\\n design of analog and mixed analog-digital integrated \\ncircuits for communication and instrumentation\\n applications. An overview of bipolar and\\n CMOS fabrication processes shows the differences \\nbetween discrete and integrated circuit design.\\n The bipolar and MOS transistors are reviewed\\n with basic device physics and the development of \\ncircuit models in various operating regions. The \\nuse of SPICE simulation in the design process\\n will be covered. Integrated amplifier circuits are\\ndeveloped with an emphasis on understanding\\n performance advantages and limitation in such areas\\n as speed, noise and power dissipation. Simple \\ncircuits are combined to form the basic functional\\n building blocks such as the op-amp, comparator,\\n voltage reference, etc. These circuit principles will \\nbe explored in an IC design project, which may\\nbe fabricated in a commercial analog process.\\n Examples of possible topics include sample-and hold \\n(S/H) amplifier, analog-to-digital (A/D) and \\ndigital-to-analog (D/A) converters, phase-locked \\nloop (PLL), voltage-controlled oscillator, phase\\n detector, switched capacitor and continuous-time \\nfilters, and sampled current techniques. (Prerequisite:\\nBackground in analog circuits both at the \\ntransistor and functional block [op-amp, comparator,\\n etc.] level. Also familiarity with techniques\\n such as small-signal modeling and analysis in the \\ns-plane using Laplace transforms. Undergraduate \\ncourse equivalent background ECE 3204; ECE \\n4902 helpful but not essential.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
