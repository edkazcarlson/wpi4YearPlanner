{"title": "STRUCTURE, BONDING, AND REACTIVITY IN INORGANIC CHEMISTRY", "level": "3410", "abbreviation": "CH", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course provides the fundamental understanding of atomic, molecular and\n solid state structures and properties. Orbital structures of atoms, symmetry of \nmolecules and point groups are used to understand chemical bonding and \nreactions. Various acid-base concepts are explored to analyze the acidity of\n cations and basicity of anions, solubility and precipitations of inorganic\n compounds, and metal-ligand binding affinities. Redox properties are discussed\n using Pourbaix diagrams. Thermodynamic stabilities of inorganic species are \ndiscussed using acid-base and redox concepts and thermochemical analyses are \nused to analyze chemical reactivity at atomic, molecular, and solid state level.\n  Recommended background: Firm understanding of general chemistry topics (CH1010 \u2013 CH1030)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
