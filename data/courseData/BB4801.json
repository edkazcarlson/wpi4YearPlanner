II \nThis course will provide an overview of bioinformatics, covering a broad\nselection of the most important techniques used to analyze biological sequence\nand expression data. Students will acquire a working knowledge of bioinformatics\napplications through hands-on use of software to ask and answer biological\nquestions. In addition, the course will provide students with an introduction to\nthe theory behind some of the most important algorithms used to analyze sequence data (for example, alignment algorithms and the use of hidden Markov\nmodels). Topics covered will include protein and DNA sequence alignments,\nevolutionary analysis and phylogenetic trees, obtaining protein secondary\nstructure from sequence, and analysis of gene expression including clustering\nmethods.\nRecommended background: BB 2920, BB 2950, and MA 2610 or 2611.\nThis is being offered in 2012-13 and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["BB"], ["2920"]], [["BB"], ["2950"]], [["MA"], ["2610"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2012"}
