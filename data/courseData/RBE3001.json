"{\"title\": \"UNIFIED ROBOTICS III\", \"level\": \"3001\", \"abbreviation\": \"RBE\", \"description\": \"Cat. I \\nThird of a four-course sequence introducing foundational theory and practice of\\nrobotics engineering from the fields of computer science, electrical engineering \\nand mechanical engineering. The focus of this course is actuator design, \\nembedded computing and complex response processes. Concepts of dynamic\\n response as relates to vibration and motion planning will be presented. The \\nprinciples of operation and interface methods various actuators will be discussed, \\nincluding pneumatic, magnetic, piezoelectric, linear, stepper, etc. Complex \\nfeedback mechanisms will be implemented using software executing in an \\nembedded system. The necessary concepts for real-time processor programming, \\nre-entrant code and interrupt signaling will be introduced. Laboratory sessions \\nwill culminate in the construction of a multi-module robotic system that\\n exemplifies methods introduced during this course. \\n\\nRecommended background: RBE 2002, ECE 2049, CS 2102, MA 2051, and \\nMA 2071.\", \"req\": [[[\"RBE\"], [\"2002\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2049\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2102\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2071\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
