"{\"title\": \"POWER SYSTEM PROTECTION AND CONTROL\", \"level\": \"5520\", \"abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"description\": \"This graduate level course seeks to provide an understanding of how interconnected power systems and their components are protected from abnormal events such as faults (short circuits), over-voltages, off-nominal frequency and unbalanced phase conditions.  This subject is presented from a theoretical viewpoint, however, many practical examples and applications are included that emphasize the limitations of existing protective equipment.  Course content is not specific to any particular manufacturer\\u2019s equipment.  \\nThe course begins with a brief review of power system operation, three-phase system calculations and the representation (modeling) of power system elements.  The modeling of current transformers under steady-state and transient conditions is presented with emphasis on the impact on protective devices.  A unit on system grounding and its impact on protective device operation are included.  Course emphasis then shifts to protective devices and their principles of operation.  Both electromechanical and numeric relay designs are covered.  The final course segments cover specific applications such as pilot protection of transmission lines, generator protection and transformer protection.
