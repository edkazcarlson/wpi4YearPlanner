{"title": "MULTI-ROBOT SYSTEMS", "level": "5204", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "This course covers the foundation and principles \nof multi-robot systems. The course will cover the\ndevelopment of the field and provide an overview \non different control architectures (deliberative,\nreactive, behavior-based and hybrid control),\n control topologies, and system configurations\n (cellular automata, modular robotic systems,\n mobile sensor networks, swarms, heterogeneous \nsystems). Topics may include, but are not limited \nto, multi-robot control and connectivity, path\n planning and localization, sensor fusion and robot \ninformatics, task-level control, and robot software\n system design and implementation. These topics\n will be pursued through independent reading,\n class discussion, and a course project. The course\n will culminate in a group project focusing on a\n collaborative/cooperative multi-robot system. The \nproject may be completed through simulation \nor hands-on experience with available robotic\n platforms. Groups will present their work and\n complete two professional-quality papers in IEEE \nformat. (Prerequisites: Linear algebra, differential\n equations, linear systems, controls, and mature\n programming skills, or consent of the instructor.)\n Students cannot receive credit for this course if they\n have taken the Special Topics (ME 593S) version of \nthe same course.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
