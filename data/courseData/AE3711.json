I \\nThis course introduces students to the aerodynamics of airfoils, wings, and aircraft in the subsonic and supersonic regimes. Topics covered include: prediction of aerodynamic forces (lift, drag) and moments, dynamic similarity, experimental techniques in aerodynamics, Kutta-Joukowski theorem, circulation, thin airfoil theory, panel methods, finite wing theory, subsonic compressible flow over airfoils, linearized supersonic flow, and viscous flow over airfoils. \\n\\nRecommended background: incompressible fluid dynamics (AE/ME 3602 or equivalent).\", \"req\": [[[\"ME\"], [\"3602\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
