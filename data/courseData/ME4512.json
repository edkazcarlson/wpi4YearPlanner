{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD", "level": "4512", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course serves as an introduction to finite element analysis (FEA) for stress\n analysis problems. Finite element equations are developed for several element\n types from stiffness and energy approaches and used to solve simple problems. \nElement types considered include spring, truss, beam, two-dimensional (plane \nstress/strain and axisymmetric solid), three-dimensional and plates. Stress\n concentrations, static failures, and fatigue failures are considered for each\n element type. Emphasis will be placed on knowing the behavior and usage of\n each element type, being able to select a suitable finite element model for a given\n problem, and being able to interpret and evaluate the solution quality. A \ncommercial, general-purpose finite element computer program is used to solve\n problems that are more complex. Projects are used to introduce the use of FEA \nin the iterative design process.\n \nRecommended background: Mathematics (MA 2051, MA 2071), Mechanics \n(ES 2501 & ES 2502 or CE 2000 & CE 2001).", "req": [[["MA"], ["2051"]], [["MA"], ["2071"]], [["ES"], ["2501"]], [["ES"], ["2502"]], [["CE"], ["2000"]], [["CE"], ["2001"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
