"{\"title\": \"HUMANITARIAN ENGINEERING: PAST AND PRESENT\", \"level\": \"200X\", \"abbreviation\": \"ES\", \"description\": \"This ES200X course will focus on understanding the engineering and humanitarian challenges connected to designing a sanitation system in the developing world or in an under-resourced part of the developed world. Students will study social and stakeholder considerations as well as treatment and transport, which will inform the design of a prototype system using appropriate locally available resources. This is a project-based, hands-on research and solution-based course in which students will be divided into teams of 3 or 4 persons each. Each team will have weekly objectives/assignments that will be presented to the whole class via oral presentations. Discussion, criticism, suggestions, etc. will follow each team's in-class presentation. The purpose of these peer evaluations is to drive the development of the final physical model of the solution, and the building of the final poster for presentation.\\nPrior registration in FY160X is required for ES200X. \\nRecommended background:  CH1010 Molecularity or General Chemistry and PH1110 General Physics - Mechanics.\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"1010\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1110\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
