I\\nThe course provides fundamental preparation for any specialized application of thermodynamics.  The material covered includes a general description of large number systems, states, canonical state variables, state functions, response functions, and equations of state.  Focus will be given to the physical meanings of free-energies, enthalpy, chemical potential, and entropy.  Connections will be made to equilibrium states, reversible versus irreversible processes, phases and phase transformation, as well as the arrow of time as applied across disciplines.\\n     Recommended background:  introductory mechanics and multi-variable calculus\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
