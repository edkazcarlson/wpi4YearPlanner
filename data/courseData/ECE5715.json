{"title": "RECONFIGURABLE COMPUTING", "level": "5715", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "This course focused on the principles and applications of using FPGAs for reconfigurable computing. The key feature of reconfigurable computing is its ability to perform computations in customized hardware, while retaining much of the flexibility of a software solution. This course provides an overview of field programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture and technology. It introduces computer-aided design tools for FPGAs including synthesis, timing, placement, and routing. The course emphasizes on the techniques to analyze algorithms and to implement them on the FPGAs. It demonstrates real-time signal and data processing in customized hardware circuits. This course also covers system-on-chip design using the embedded processors inside the FPGAs. Partially reconfiguration and runtime reconfiguration design flow are also included.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
