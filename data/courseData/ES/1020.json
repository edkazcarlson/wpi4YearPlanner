I\\nThis course is for first year students with an interest in engineering. The course\\nfocuses on the design process. Students are introduced to engineering through\\n case studies and reverse engineering activities. Students will learn the steps in the \\ndesign process and how engineers use this process to create new devices. Teams\\n of students are then assigned a design project that culminates in building and\\n evaluating a prototype of their design. Results of the design project are presented \\nin both oral and written reports. This course does not require any prior\\n engineering background. \\n     Note: This course can be used towards the Engineering Science and Design \\ndistribution requirement in IE and ME.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
