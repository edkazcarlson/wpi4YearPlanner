"{\"Course Name\": \"CONTROL ENGINEERING I\", \"Course Level\": \"3011\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ES\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nCharacteristics of control systems. Mathematical representation of control\\ncomponents and systems. Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block and\\n signal flow diagrams. Transient response analysis. Introduction to the root-locus \\nmethod and stability analysis. Frequency response techniques including Bode, \\npolar, and Nichols plots.\\n\\nThis sequence of courses in the field of control engineering (ES 3011) is \\ngenerally available to all juniors and seniors regardless of department. A good \\nbackground in mathematics is required; familiarity with Laplace transforms, \\ncomplex variables and matrices is desirable but not mandatory. All students \\ntaking Control Engineering I should have an understanding of ordinary \\ndifferential equations (MA 2051 or equivalent) and basic physics through \\nelectricity and magnetism (PH 1120/1121). Control Engineering I may be \\nconsidered a terminal course, or it may be the first course for those students\\nwishing to do extensive work in this field. Students taking the sequence of two \\ncourses will be prepared for graduate work in the field.\\n \\nRecommended background: Ordinary Differential Equations (MA 2051) and \\nElectricity and Magnestism (PH 1120, PH 1121).\\nStudents may not receive credit for both ES 3011 and ECE 3012.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1120\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1121\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3011\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"3012\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
