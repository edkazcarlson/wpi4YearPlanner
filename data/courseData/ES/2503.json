"{\"Course Name\": \"INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMIC SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"2503\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ES\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nEngineers should be able to formulate and solve problems that involve forces that\\nact on bodies which are moving. This course deals with the kinematics and \\ndynamics of particles and rigid bodies which move in a plane.\\n Topics covered will include: kinematics of particles and rigid bodies, equations \\nof motion, work-energy methods, and impulse and momentum. In this course a \\nbasic introduction to mechanical vibration is also discussed. Basic equations will\\n be developed with respect to translating and rotating coordinate systems.\\n \\nRecommended background: Statics (ES 2501 or CE 2000).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"CE\"], [\"2000\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
