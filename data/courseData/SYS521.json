"{\"title\": \"MODEL BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING\", \"level\": \"521\", \"abbreviation\": \"SYS\", \"description\": \"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) formalizes the practice of systems engineering through the use of models. This course is intended to answer the why, what and how of MBSE. The course provides background and motivation for transitioning to MBSE from a document centric approach to systems engineering. The course provides a foundation for MBSE by first introducing SysML as a descriptive language for modeling systems in terms of their requirements, structure, behavior, and parametric constraints. The course then introduces the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) as a method for applying SysML to support the specification, architecture design, analysis, and verification of complex systems.  A systems modeling tool is also introduced and used throughout the course.\\n     Applying MBSE on class projects help the student to grasp the fundamentals. This course is expected to provide the foundations of the systems modeling language, method, and tool to enable the student to get started with MBSE on real projects.   \\n(Prerequisite: SYS 501 Concepts of Systems Engineering)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
