{"title": "PROBABILITY", "level": "2631", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThe purpose of this course is twofold:\n- To introduce the student to probability. Topics to be covered will be chosen \nfrom: axiomatic development of probability; independence; Bayes theorem;\n discrete and continuous random variables; expectation; special distributions\n including the binomial and normal; moment generating functions; multivariate\n distributions; conditional and marginal distributions; independence \nof random variables; transformations of random variables; limit theorems.\n- To introduce fundamental ideas and methods of mathematics using the \nstudy of probability as the vehicle. These ideas and methods may include\n systematic theorem-proof development starting with basic axioms; \nmathematical induction; set theory; applications of univariate and \nmultivariate calculus.\n \nThis course is designed primarily for Mathematical Sciences majors and those \ninterested in the deeper mathematical issues underlying probability theory.\n \nRecommended background: MA 1024. \nUndergraduate credit may not be earned both for this course and for MA 2621.", "req": [[["MA"], ["1024"]], [["MA"], ["2621"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
