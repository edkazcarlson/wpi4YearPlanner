"{\"title\": \"INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIETY\", \"level\": \"1200\", \"abbreviation\": \"DEV\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\nWhat is development? How has international development been understood and what has been done about it? How do development scholars explain why some countries are rich while others are poor? How can students understand and incorporate development studies in the contexts of their own global engagements? This course addresses these questions by looking at theories, ideologies, and processes that have influenced and embodied development thinking and practice over the past five decades. We will examine the role of colonization, modernization, dependency, globalization, democratization, industrialization, and urbanization in processes of development in countries across the globe. The course encourages students to think critically about what development is, about how it is carried out and, most importantly of all, about what it can achieve. DEV 1200 provides excellent preparation for international projects and careers.\\nRecommended background: No recommended background.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
