{"title": "SPACECRAFT PROPULSION", "level": "5111", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "(2 Credits)\nThis course provides students with the background and theory needed to evaluate the performance of the most commonly used electric and chemical spacecraft propulsion systems. Electrostatic ion and Hall thruster theory, design, and operation are covered including theory and operation of hollow cathodes, plasma\ngeneration and ion acceleration (including design of ion optics), magnetic field design, and beam neutralization. Topics in chemical propulsion include bipropellant \nand monopropellant chemistry (adiabatic flame temperature and ideal performance) with a focus on catalyst-bed and nozzle design considerations. Discussion of each class of thruster will be supplemented with specific examples of\nflight hardware.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
