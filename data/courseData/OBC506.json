"{\"title\": \"THE HEART OF LEADERSHIP: POWER, REFLECTION, AND INTERPERSONAL SKILLS\", \"level\": \"506\", \"abbreviation\": \"OBC\", \"description\": \"All of us hope to have positive, collaborative, and effective interactions with others \\u2014 in our professional and personal lives. Yet often our interactions do not go as planned and it gets ugly: people behave irrationally and get emotional, communication stops, conflicts fester, and opportunities are left unrealized and obscured. This course develops skills for understanding and acting more powerfully, ethically, and mindfully in our interactions. These include analytic techniques for understanding emotional, biographical, and social-psychological reasons for our own and others behavior, and skills for paying attention to and managing the complex dynamics unfolding in interpersonal interactions. Students will learn to identify and reflect upon their own contributions to problematic interactions; design and execute better ways of interacting with others; and develop their own interpersonal strengths and collaborative capacities. (Prerequisite: OBC 505 or instructor consent) (Students cannot get credit for OBC 506 and OBC 501)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
