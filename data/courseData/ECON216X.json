{"title": "ECONOMIC LESSONS FROM THE DUTCH GOLDEN AGE", "level": "216X", "abbreviation": "ECON", "description": "During the 17th century, the Dutch became a world power, laying the foundation for much of our modern world.  Despite the region\u2019s scarce natural resources, the people of the Dutch Republic turned their country into the premier manufacturing, trading and financial center. The rich and the rising middle class became the main clients of Dutch artists and influenced a wide array of subjects that provide insight into everyday life in 17th-century Holland.   We will use the visual arts to study the economic behavior of individuals, businesses, government, and other institutions and draw parallels to modern economies. We will learn, for example, about the tulip mania, the first documented speculative asset bubble, and discover that the Dutch were not that different from the exuberant traders of the modern stock market. The course will cover relevant topics in economic theory and will provide opportunities for students to conduct basic economic analysis. A major resource for the course will be the Worcester Art Museum\u2019s rich holdings of Netherlandish art. On-campus PowerPoint presentations will be complemented by regular visits to the galleries as well as a visit to the Print Room. \nRecommended background: None.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
