All of these have become part of our American lives, but where did they come from and what meaning do they hold as cultural phenomena? In this class we will explore the popular cultures of East Asia to better understand the influences that have shaped the region\u2019s contemporary societies. Focus country will be either Japan or China, depending on term offered. Students will study various media of popular culture, such as films, songs, advertisements, video games, manga, anime, to explore the changing society of these countries. We will link the individual cultural phenomena studied to both internal and external influences, situating popular culture within transnational currents and exchanges when appropriate. No prior knowledge of Asian history is required for this class.\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
