{"title": "DATA VISUALIZATION", "level": "480X", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "This course exposes students to the field of data visualization, i.e., the graphical communication of data and information for the purposes of presentation, confirmation, and exploration. The course introduces the stages of the visualization pipeline. This includes data modeling, mapping data attributes to graphical attributes, visual display techniques, tools, paradigms, and perceptual issues. Students learn to evaluate the effectiveness of visualizations for specific data, task, and user types. Students implement visualization algorithms and undertake projects involving the use of commercial and public-domain visualization tools.\nRecommended background: Knowledge of Linear Algebra (such as MA 2071), Probability theory (MA 2621), and Software Engineering (CS 3733).", "req": [[["MA"], ["2071"]], [["MA"], ["2621"]], [["CS"], ["3733"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
