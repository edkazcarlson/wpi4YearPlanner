"{\"title\": \"LEGGED ROBOTICS\", \"level\": \"521\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"Foundations and principles of parallel manipulators and legged robots. Topics include advanced spatial/3D kinematics and dynamics of parallel manipulators and legged robots including workspace analysis, inverse and forward kinematics and dynamics, motion analysis and control, and gait and stability/balance analysis of legged robots. The course will be useful for solving problems dealing with parallel manipulators as well as multi-legged robots including, but not limited to, quadruped robots, hexapod robots and any other types of multi-legged robots. A final term project allows students to show mastery of the subject by designing, analyzing, and simulating parallel and/or legged robots of their choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended Background: RBE 500, RBE 501\\r\\n\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
