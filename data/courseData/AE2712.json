"{\"title\": \"INTRODUCTION TO AEROSPACE STRUCTURES\", \"level\": \"2712\", \"abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"description\": \"This course introduces the basic concepts of stress analysis and extensively covers mechanics of aerospace structures under bending loads. Topics include: Three-dimensional stress and strain, stress transformation and Mohr\\u2019s circle, basic constitutive relationships, statically determinate and indeterminate one-dimensional problems, thermal stresses, and stress distributions and deflections of structural elements under bending loads. The laboratory component of this course will introduce the students to basic constitutive behavior of isotropic and anisotropic composites materials.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
