"{\"title\": \"UNIFIED ROBOTICS IV\", \"level\": \"3002\", \"abbreviation\": \"RBE\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nFourth of a four-course sequence introducing foundational theory and practice \\nof robotics engineering from the fields of computer science, electrical engineering\\n and mechanical engineering. The focus of this course is navigation, position \\nestimation and communications. Concepts of dead reckoning, landmark \\nupdates, inertial sensors, and radio location will be explored. Control systems as\\n applied to navigation will be presented. Communication, remote control and \\nremote sensing for mobile robots and tele-robotic systems will be introduced.\\n Wireless communications including wireless networks and typical local and wide\\n area networking protocols will be discussed. Considerations will be discussed \\nregarding operation in difficult environments such as underwater, aerospace,\\nhazardous, etc. Laboratory sessions will be directed towards the solution of an\\n open-ended problem over the course of the entire term.\\n \\nRecommended background: RBE 3001, ES 3011, MA 2621, or MA 2631.\", \"req\": [[[\"RBE\"], [\"3001\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3011\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2621\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2631\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
