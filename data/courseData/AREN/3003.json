"{\"Course Name\": \"PRINCIPLES OF HVAC DESIGN FOR BUILDINGS\", \"Course Level\": \"3003\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThe course introduces principles and applications of mechanical systems that are\\nrequired for environmental comfort, health, and safety of building occupants \\nwith a focus on energy efficiency and conservation. Topics include psychometrics, \\nthermal comfort, building heating and cooling loads, fluid flow basics,\\n HVAC components and systems, building envelop heat transfer, and energy\\nrequirements. In the course, students develop the ability to design and conduct\\ncomputational modelling experiments and to analyze and interpret output data\\n for selection between system alternatives in order to optimize energy use.\\nRecommended background: Thermodynamics.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
