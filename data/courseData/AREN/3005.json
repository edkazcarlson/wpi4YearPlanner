"{\"Course Name\": \"LIGHTING SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"3005\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThis course focuses on the design of illumination systems in buildings. It provides a general introduction to the visual environment, including subjective and objective scales of measurement, visual perception, photometry, brightness, luminance, illumination, natural and artificial lighting. Other topics include photometric units, light sources, daylight luminaries, lighting quality, light loss factors, average\\nluminance calculations (lumen method), point-by-point calculations, performance impacts, and ethics. Field measurements and computer simulations are used to explore some major aspects of architectural illumination systems. Design problems are solved by considering economic evaluation, energy saving\\ncriteria and applicable standards and building codes.\\n     Recommended background: electrical systems (AREN 2025 or equivalent)\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"AREN\"], [\"2025\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
