"{\"Course Name\": \"ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN V - BUILDING ENVELOPE DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"3022\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"Course Description\": \"This course aims to develop an understanding of the architectural design development process with special focus on the design and detailing of building envelopes. Studio: Through an iterative process, students will advance the architectural and technical development of an architectural project of increased complexity. Modeling and simulation software, orthographic drawings, detail drawings, and physical models are used to advance the development of architectural design concepts. Lectures: The lecture component of the course covers the basic principles of building envelope design, focusing primarily on functional performance requirements and practical constructability aspects. Various building envelope systems are reviewed, including fa\\u00e7ade and roofing systems made of masonry, stone, concrete, timber, glass, and various metals. More elaborate building envelope strategies will also be reviewed; such as double skin facades and passive solar design approaches. Students will be introduced to computer tools and other methods for the analysis of heat and moisture transfer within building envelopes and components thereof. \\nThis course uses studio and lecture based teaching methods \\nRecommended background: Building Physics and HVAC system design (AREN 3024 and AREN 3003) and Architectural Design (AREN 2002, AREN 2004, and AREN 3002 or equivalent). \\nStudents may not receive credit for both AREN 3022 and AREN 3026\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"AREN\"], [\"3024\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"3003\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"2002\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"2004\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"3002\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"3022\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"3026\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
