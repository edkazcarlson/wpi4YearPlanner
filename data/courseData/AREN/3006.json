"{\"Course Name\": \"ADVANCED HVAC SYSTEM DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"3006\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nAnalysis of heating and cooling load requirements, considering building\\nconstruction type, geometry, infiltration, occupancy effects, and daily load\\nvariations. Heating design addresses water heating systems, electrical heating,\\ncentral heating, heating of low and high-rise buildings, selection of heaters, \\nboilers, pumps, piping design. Cooling design addresses refrigerants, refrigeration \\ncycle, evaporator, compressor, condenser, thermostatic expansion valves,\\n refrigeration system control equipment, motor and motor control equipment,\\n refrigeration accessories, calculation of refrigeration piping and absorption\\n systems. Computer applications for heating and cooling load analysis will be \\nintroduced to develop energy saving solutions. Analytical techniques and\\n building codes are discussed through case studies and design projects.\\n \\nRecommended background: AREN 3003, ES 3004.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"AREN\"], [\"3003\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3004\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
