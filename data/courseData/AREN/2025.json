"{\"Course Name\": \"BUILDING ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"2025\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThe principles of electrical system design in buildings are introduced in this course. Starting with an overview of electrical fundamentals and related laws, it covers circuit design, power distribution and service equipment, communication systems and special electrical systems that meet the requirements of the national electric code as well as building occupants. Other topics include single-phase and three-phase circuits, electrical and lighting loads, panel-board design, switching, system sizing, grounding, fault calculations, and over-current protection. The design criteria and calculation procedures for developing simple layouts of building electrical systems are illustrated. Work includes study of applicable NFPA 70\\n(NEC) and related building codes.\\n     Recommended background: electricity and magnetism (PH 1120/1121 or equivalent)\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"PH\"], [\"1120\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
