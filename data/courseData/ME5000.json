"{\"title\": \"APPLIED ANALYTICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING\", \"level\": \"5000\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"The emphasis of this course is on the modeling of \\nphysical phenomena encountered in typical engineering \\nproblems, and on interpreting solutions \\nin terms of the governing physics. In this manner,\\nthe course will expose students to a range of\\n techniques that are useful to practicing engineers\\n and researchers. Physical examples will be drawn \\nfrom fluid mechanics, dynamics, and structural\\nmechanics. The course will introduce analytical\\n techniques as they are required to study such phenomena.\\n Depending on the examples chosen, the\\n techniques covered may include partial differential \\nequations, power series, Fourier series, Fourier\\n integrals, Laplace transform methods, Green's \\nFunctions, Sturm-Liouville theory, linear algebra, \\nand calculus of variations. (Prerequisites: differential\\n equations at the undergraduate level.) Students\\n cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken \\neither the Special Topics (ME 593A) version of the\\n same course or ME 500.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
