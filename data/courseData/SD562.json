{"title": "PROJECT DYNAMICS", "level": "562", "abbreviation": "SD", "description": "This course will introduce students to the fundamental \ndynamics that drive project performance, \nincluding the rework cycle, feedback effects, and \ninter-phase \u201cknock-on\u201d effects. Topics covered include \ndynamic project problems and their causes:\n the rework cycle and feedback effects, knock-on\n effects between project phases; modeling the\n dynamics: feedback effects, schedule pressure and \nstaffing, schedule changes, inter-phase dependencies\n and precedence; strategic project management:\nproject planning, project preparation, risk \nmanagement, project adaptation and execution\n cross project learning; multi-project issues. A\n simple project model will be created, and used in\n assignments to illustrate the principles of \u201cstrategic\n project management.\u201d Case examples of different \napplications will be discussed.
