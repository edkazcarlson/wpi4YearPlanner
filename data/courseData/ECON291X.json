{"title": "ECONOMICS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "level": "291X", "abbreviation": "ECON", "description": "This course is designed to provide an introduction to economics, an introduction to entrepreneurship, and an understanding of the linkages between economics and entrepreneurship. Students will apply these concepts to the assessment of opportunities that might arise from participation in WPI projects.  Students will engage in exploring how economics and entrepreneurship can inform opportunity assessment within an ambiguous and uncertain context.  These decisions are always made with incomplete information and there is typically no single correct answer but rather multiple possible answers -- each with pluses and minuses.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
