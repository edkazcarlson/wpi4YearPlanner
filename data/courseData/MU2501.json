{"title": "MUSIC AND MIND", "level": "2501", "abbreviation": "MU", "description": "How are we able to distinguish instruments, timbres and rhythms from the intertwined sonic stream presented by the world?  How do we organize these elements in time to create rhythms, melodies, phrases and pieces? How do perception and memory interact to allow us navigate a musical work?  We will explore these questions by considering the cognitive and perceptual processes that shape our musical experience.  Topics will include event distinction, temporal perception, hierarchical organization, perceptual grouping, expertise, memory and categorization. We will illustrate these ideas in musical contexts by listening to a variety of musical works. We will consider how psychological principles are applied to music technologies, such as compression algorithms, mixing methodologies and the field of music information retrieval.  We will consider experiments that focus on some of these topics to further our understanding about how we experience music.\n     Recommeded background: Fundamentals of Music I and/or Fundamentals of Music II.\n     Note: Students that received credit for MU202x cannot receive credit for MU2501.
