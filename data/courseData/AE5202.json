"{\"title\": \"ADVANCED DYNAMICS\", \"level\": \"5202\", \"abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"description\": \"(2 credits)\\nBasic concepts and general principles of classical kinematics and dynamics of particles, systems of particles and rigid bodies are presented with application to engineering problems with complicated three- dimensional kinematics and dynamics. Derivation of the governing equations of motion using Principle of Virtual Work and Lagrange equations is described together with the direct Newton  approach. Applications include: swings-effect and its use in engineering, illustrating in particular limit cycles and their stability and reversed-swings control of vibrations of pendulum; various examples of gyroscopic effects; and especially introductory rotordynamics including transverse vibrations (whirling) and potential instability of rotating shafts. \\nStudents cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics (ME 593D) version of the same course or ME 527.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
