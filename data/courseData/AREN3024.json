"{\"title\": \"BUILDING PHYSICS\", \"level\": \"3024\", \"abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\nThe course introduces the principles of building physics, as they are applied to various building design situations and performance requirements. Covered topics include heat transfer, moisture control, condensation, cold bridging, external and internal gains, and air flows, as they pertain to building envelopes (external walls, windows and doors, and roofs) and the requirements of environmental comfort\\nof space occupants. Design exercises take into account pertinent building and energy codes as well as comfort standards. The course gives students the tools to integrate engineering science fundamentals and physics principles in developing building design solutions. Thermal measurements in building components are performed.\\n     Recommended background: thermodynamics and heat transfer (ES 3001, ES 3003 or equivalent).\", \"req\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"3001\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3003\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
