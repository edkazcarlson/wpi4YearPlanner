"{\"title\": \"STOCHASTIC MODELS\", \"level\": \"3510\", \"abbreviation\": \"OIE\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\r\\nThis is an introductory course in probabilistic models and decision-making under\\r\\nrisk, with applications to engineering and management decision making. The\\r\\n course first covers quantitative methods for assessing and evaluating risks and how\\r\\n they are used in decision making. Decision making under risk is examined across a \\r\\nwide set of management and engineering problems. The course then introduces a \\r\\nset of probabilistic models commonly used in decision making and operations \\r\\nimprovement; specifically, emphasis is placed on Markov chains, Poisson processes, \\r\\nand queuing theory, and their applications in manufacturing and service systems are \\r\\nillustrated.\\r\\n \\r\\n     Recommended background: knowledge of calculus and introductory probability\\r\\nand statistics.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
