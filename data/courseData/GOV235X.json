"{\"title\": \"INTERNTIONAL MIGRATION AND POLITICS\", \"level\": \"235X\", \"abbreviation\": \"GOV\", \"description\": \"This course investigates the causes and effects of human movement from a political perspective. It explores many questions related to the movement of people across international borders such as: Why do people move across borders and how should local communities, national government, and international organization respond? Should countries have borders and, if so, how should they decide who is allowed entry and who should be denied entry? What types of obligations should a host country have towards immigrants and what responsibility should an immigrant have to the receiving society? Should citizenship be earned or automatic? How are women and children impacted by migration? How has immigration become a security issue in international relations? How has climate change impacted human migration? By the end of the term, students should gain critical insight into the language that fuels policy debates about migration.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended background: Students are encouraged to take this course to broaden their understanding of public policies as it relates to the movement of people across international borders.
