{"title": "LEBESGUE MEASURE AND INTEGRATION", "level": "503", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "This course begins with a review of topics normally \ncovered in undergraduate analysis courses: \nopen, closed and compact sets; liminf and limsup;\n continuity and uniform convergence. Next the \ncourse covers Lebesgue measure in Rn including \nthe Cantor set, the concept of a sigma-algebra, the\nconstruction of a nonmeasurable set, measurable \nfunctions, semicontinuity, Egorov\u2019s and Lusin\u2019s\ntheorems, and convergence in measure. Next \nwe cover Lebesgue integration, integral convergence\ntheorems (monotone and dominated), \nTchebyshev\u2019s inequality and Tonelli\u2019s and Fubini\u2019s\n theorems. Finally Lp spaces are introduced with\n emphasis on L2 as a Hilbert space. Other related\n topics will be covered at the instructor\u2019s discretion. (Prerequisite: Basic knowledge of undergraduate\n analysis is assumed.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
