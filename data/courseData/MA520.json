"{\"title\": \"FOURIER TRANSFORMS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\", \"level\": \"520\", \"abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"description\": \"The course will cover L1, L2, L\\u221e and basic facts\\n from Hilbert space theory (Hilbert basis, projection\\ntheorems, Riesz theory). The first part of \\nthe course will introduce Fourier series: the L2\\n theory, the C\\u221e theory: rate of convergence, Fourier\\n series of real analytic functions, application to \\nthe trapezoidal rule, Fourier transforms in L1,\\n Fourier integrals of Gaussians, the Schwartz class \\nS, Fourier transforms and derivatives, translations, \\nconvolution, Fourier transforms in L2, and \\ncharacteristic functions of probability distribution \\nfunctions. The second part of the course will cover \\ntempered distributions and applications to partial \\ndifferential equations. Other related topics will be \\ncovered at the instructor\\u2019s discretion.
