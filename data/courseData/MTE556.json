{"title": "SMART MATERIALS", "level": "556", "abbreviation": "MTE", "description": "A material whose properties can respond to an external stimulus in a controlled fashion is referred to as a smart or intelligent material.  These materials can be made to undergo changes modulus, shape, porosity, electrical conductivity, physical form, opacity, and magnetic properties based on an external stimulus.  The stimuli can include temperature, pH, specific molecules, light, magnetic field, voltage and stress.   These stimuli-sensitive materials can be utilized as sensors and as vehicles for the controlled delivery of drugs and other biomolecules in medical applications.  Smart materials are also becoming important in other biological areas such as bio-separation, biosensor design, tissue engineering, protein folding, and microfluidics.  The use of stimuli-sensitive materials is receiving increasing attention in the development of damage tolerant smart structures in aerospace, marine, automotive and earth quake resistant buildings.   The use of smart materials is being explored for a range of applications including protective coatings, corrosion barriers, intelligent batteries, fabrics and food packaging.  The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the various types of smart materials including polymers, ceramic, metallic alloys and composites.  Fundamental principles associated with the onset of \u201csmart\u201d property will be highlighted.  The principles of self-healable materials based on smart materials will be discussed.  The application of smart materials in various fields including sensors, actuators, diagnostics, therapeutics, packaging and other advanced applications will be presented. Note: Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics version of the same course.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
