Throughout the course, the probable paths of evolution of the immune system will be stressed.  As examples of major genetic diseases of immunity, case studies will be discussed on a weekly basis.\\nRecommended background: BB 2550 (Cell biology), BB 2920 (Genetics), CH 4110 and 4120 (Biochemistry I and II) or equivalents.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2920\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"4110\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
