The \\nprocesses are dealt with at the physiological and \\nthe system level, with emphasis on the means by \\nwhich useful conversions can be harnessed in a \\nbiologically intelligent way. The laboratory focuses \\non measurements of microbial physiology and on \\nbench-scale process design.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
