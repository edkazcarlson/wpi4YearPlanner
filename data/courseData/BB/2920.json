"{\"Course Name\": \"GENETICS\", \"Course Level\": \"2920\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThrough interactive lectures, group problem solving, and analysis of primary scientific literature, this course will help students understand the gene concept and its application in modern biological analysis. This course will cover patterns of inheritance, the relationship between genotype and phenotype, and the transmission, coding, and expression of genetic information contained in DNA, in several model systems.  Students will gain an understanding of the modern tools of genetic analysis, including gene cloning, creation of transgenic organisms, high-throughput sequencing and RNA interference. Applications of genetic analysis to current advancements in agriculture through crop improvements, and in human health, including gene therapy and personalized medicine, will be explored.  \\n\\nRecommended background: BB 1035 (Biotechnology) or equivalent\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"1035\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
