"{\"Course Name\": \"NEUROBIOLOGY\", \"Course Level\": \"3080\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThe nervous system underlies every aspect of our behavior, including sensation, movement, emotion, and cognition.  In this course, students will develop an understanding of neurobiology at several levels, from the physiology of individual neurons, through the functioning of neural circuits, and finally to the behavior of neural systems such as vision, motion, and memory.  The class will be based on lectures accompanied by in-class activities, and will include weekly discussion of a paper from the scientific literature.   The class will focus each year on a guiding theme, such as a particular neurotransmitter system, and will emphasize research on human neurological problems, such as schizophrenia, addiction, Alzheimer's disease, and autism.\\n\\nRecommended background: BB2550 (Cell Biology), and either BB2920 (Genetics) or BB2950 Molecular Biology) or equivalent \\nSuggested additional background: BB 3101 (Anatomy & Physiology: Movement and Communication) or equivalent\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2920\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2950\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"3101\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
