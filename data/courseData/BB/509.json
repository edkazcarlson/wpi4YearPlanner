"{\"Course Name\": \"SCALE UP OF BIOPROCESSING\", \"Course Level\": \"509\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"Course Description\": \"(3 Credits)\\nStrategies for optimization of bioprocesses for scale-up applications will be explored. In addition \\nto the theory of scaling up unit operations in bioprocessing, students will scale up \\na bench-scale bioprocess (5 liters) including fermentation and downstream\\n processing to 55 liters. Specific topics include the effects of scaling-up on: mass\\ntransfer and bioreactor design, harvesting techniques including tangential flow\\n filtration and centrifugation, and chromatography (open column and HPLC).\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
