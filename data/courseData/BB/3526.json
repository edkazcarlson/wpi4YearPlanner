"{\"Course Name\": \"PHAGE HUNTERS: THE ANALYSIS\", \"Course Level\": \"3526\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"Course Description\": \"In this computer lab students will work with phage genomic sequences obtained from novel bacteriophages isolated in BB2910, Phage Hunters: The Quest. The raw genome files will be finished and oriented; students will then search the sequence to identify and map existing genes and other genomic components (sequence annotation). Additional course goals are to do an initial comparative genomic analysis and post-annotation experimentation. The ultimate goal is to produce novel bacteriophage genome sequences that are ready to be submitted to GenBank, the US repository of DNA sequence information at the National Institute of Health. Recommended background: a working knowledge of genome structure and function (BB 2920, BB2950, or equivalent).\\nStudents planning to take this course may wish to consider enrollment in BB 2916 (Phage Hunters: The Quest)\\nStudents may not receive credit for both BB 350X and BB 3526\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"2920\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2950\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2916\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"350X\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"3526\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
