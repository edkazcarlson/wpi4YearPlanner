"{\"Course Name\": \"MODEL SYSTEMS: EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES AND APPLICATIONS\", \"Course Level\": \"561\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"Course Description\": \"(2 Credits)\\nThe course is intended to introduce students to \\nthe use of model experimental systems in modern\\n biological research. The course covers prokaryotic\\n and eukaryotic systems including microbial (Escherichia \\ncoli) and single cells eukaryotes (fungi); \\ninvertebrate (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila \\nmelanogaster) and vertebrate (mice, zebra fish)\\n systems and plants (moss, algae and Arabidopsis\\n thaliana). Use of these systems in basic and applied \\nresearch will be examined. Students may receive\\n credit for either BB 561 or a BB 570 course entitled\\n Model Systems: Experimental Approaches and \\nApplications but not both.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
