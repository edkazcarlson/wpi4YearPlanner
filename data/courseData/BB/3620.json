"{\"Course Name\": \"DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY\", \"Course Level\": \"3620\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II \\nThrough lecture, reading, and discussion, this course will help students understand how developmental biologists study the development of a fertilized egg into a multi-cellular animal.  Beginning with the description of developmental events, the major problems of developmental biology such as determination of cell fate, differentiation, and pattern formation will be explored.  Emphasis will be placed on techniques such as analysis of mutations, molecular genetics, gene transfer, and the use of model organisms.  Societal implications of the ability to control the outcome of development will be discussed.\\n\\nRecommended background: BB 2002 (Microbiology), BB 2550 (Cell Biology), BB 2920 (Genetics) or equivalent \\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16 and alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"2002\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2920\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2015\"}"
