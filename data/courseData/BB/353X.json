"{\"Course Name\": \"IMMUNOTHERAPIES: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS\", \"Course Level\": \"353X\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"Course Description\": \"While the production of monoclonal antibodies has been around since the 1970s, their clinical use as human therapeutics represents an increasingly popular and promising application. Beginning with a hybridoma cell line and using a discovery based approach, students in this course will explore the processes involved in the production and purification of monoclonal antibodies.  Using cells in culture to produce the antibody, students will explore the efficacy and cost of a purification scheme involving separation techniques such as ion exchange and affinity chromatography to produce a purified product. Purification will be assessed using typical analytical techniques such as spectroscopy, electrophoresis and immunological based methods.\\nRecommended background: a working knowledge of laboratory skills in enzyme and protein purification (BB 2902) and concepts in cell biology and biochemistry (BB2550 and CH4110 or equivalent).Some knowledge of immunology may be beneficial.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"2902\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"4110\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
