I\\nThis course will provide an introduction to the scientific study of animal behavior.   A combination of lecture, reading, and video will be used to illustrate how proximate and ultimate forces interact to shape animal behavior in complex and fascinating ways.  Behavioral phenomena in all members of the animal kingdom will be discussed and analyzed from ecological, evolutionary, cognitive, and neurobiological perspectives to highlight how the use of an integrative approach has greatly accelerated our ability to solve complex behavioral problems.  Primary scientific literature will be used to outline experimental tools and techniques used to investigate behavior in different contexts, including communication, foraging, navigation, mate choice, predation, and social behavior.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
