"{\"title\": \"QUANTUM CHEMISTRY\", \"level\": \"3530\", \"abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"description\": \"Cat. I \\n\\nAn introduction to quantum mechanics with applications to atomic and\\n molecular species. The course will be developed systematically beginning with \\nthe postulates of quantum mechanics. The Schroedinger equation will be\\n applied to systems such as the particle in a box, the rigid rotor, the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. Emphasis will be given to a quantum \\nmechanical description of multielectron atoms, molecular bonding and\\n spectroscopy.\\n \\nRecommended background: a solid foundation in elementary physics and \\ncalculus.\\n This course is normally for students in their third year.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
