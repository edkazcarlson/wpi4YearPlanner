{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO CONTROL OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS", "level": "3703", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "Cat. I \nThe course introduces the mathematical modeling and control of dynamical systems found in aerospace and mechanical engineering applications. Topics include: introduction to feedback control analysis and synthesis of linear dynamic systems; transient response analysis of first and second order systems (thermal, pneumatic, hydraulic, and mechanical); introduction to state-space modeling and representation of control systems; linearization of nonlinear systems; stability analysis using Routh\u2019s criterion and Lyapunov methods; system analysis using frequency response methods; introduction to the design of controlers in time and frequency domain. The analysis and design will be\naccomplished with Matlab/Simulink\u00ae software. \n\nRecommended background: ordinary differential equations (MA 2051 or equivalent), dynamics (ES 2503, PH 2201, PH 2202 or equivalent), fluid dynamics (ES3004, AE/ME 3602 or equivalent), electricity and magnetism (PH 1120 or PH 1121 or equivalent)", "req": [[["MA"], ["2051"]], [["ES"], ["2503"]], [["PH"], ["2201"]], [["PH"], ["2202"]], [["ES"], ["3004"]], [["ME"], ["3602"]], [["PH"], ["1120"]], [["PH"], ["1121"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
