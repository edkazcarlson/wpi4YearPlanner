"{\"Course Name\": \"TEACHING METHODS IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE\", \"Course Level\": \"3100\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ID\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nWithin the context of contemporary secondary education in mathematics and\\nscience (biology, chemistry, physics), ID 3100 introduces and demonstrates \\neffective teaching methods as they relate to curriculum goals and current\\n methods of assessment. These methods take into account diverse learning styles\\n as well as various technological resources. Topics to be covered include: a brief \\nhistory of education; curriculum and course guidelines (Massachusetts\\n Education Reform and regulations 603 CMR 7.00, state curricular frameworks,\\n national standards); legal issues; developing a course syllabus; and the issue of \\nbreadth versus depth in course planning and delivery. The course also covers \\npractical questions of organizing, delivering and assessing a course. This course is\\nintended primarily for students interested in completing the Massachusetts\\n requirements for teacher licensing. This program is aimed primarily at majors in\\n mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology wishing to be licensed to teach in \\nmiddle or high school in one of those disciplines. A portion of the course\\n requires the observation of master teachers at the Massachusetts Academy of\\n Mathematics and Science, who will work with all students in the course to assist\\n them in beginning to acquire the appropriate skills to conduct their own classes \\nin mathematics or science at the secondary school level.\\n     Recommended background: SS 2401, Psychology of Education.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"SS\"], [\"2401\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
