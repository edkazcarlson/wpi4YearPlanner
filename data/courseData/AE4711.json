"{\"title\": \"FUNDAMENTALS OF AIR-BREATHING PROPULSION\", \"level\": \"4711\", \"abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"description\": \"This course introduces the principles of operation of air-breathing engines, including gas-turbines (turbojets, turbofans, and turboprops), ramjets, and scramjets. Topics covered include: engine thrust and efficiency analysis; working principles and performance analysis of diffusers, compressors, combustors, and nozzles; parametric cycle analysis; effect of irreversibilities on performance. The topics covered are also relevant to the operation of gas-turbines used for power generation. \\nRecommended background: thermodynamics (ES 3001, CH 3510, PH 2101 or equivalent), compressible fluid dynamics (AE/ME 3410 or equivalent). \\nStudents may not receive credit for both AE 4710 and AE 4711.\", \"req\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"3001\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"3510\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"2101\"]], [[\"ME\"], [\"3410\"]], [[\"AE\"], [\"4710\"]], [[\"AE\"], [\"4711\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
