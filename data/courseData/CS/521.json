"{\"Course Name\": \"LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE\", \"Course Level\": \"521\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"This course is an introduction to mathematical\\n logic from a computer science perspective. Topics \\ncovered include the exploration of model theory,\\n proof theory, and decidability for propositional\\n and first-order classical logics, as well as various \\nnon-classical logics that provide useful tools for\\n computer science (such as temporal and intuitionistic\\n logics). The course stresses the application \\nof logic to various areas of computer science such\\n as computability, theorem proving, programming \\nlanguages, specification, and verification. The specific \\napplications included will vary by instructor.\\n(Prerequisites: CS 503, or equivalent background \\nin basic models of computation.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
