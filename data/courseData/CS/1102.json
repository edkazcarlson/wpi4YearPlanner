"{\"Course Name\": \"ACCELERATED INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAM DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"1102\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"In the first half of the term, this course covers the same functional programming material as CS 1101 at roughly twice the pace.  The second half of the term is a preview of selected advanced Computer Science topics, such as the design and implementation of application-specific languages, macros, programming with the HTTP protocol and continuation-passing style. Students will be expected to complete an open-ended individual programming project.  \\n     Recommended background: Substantial prior programming experience (including functions, recursion, and lists, as would be covered in high-school Advanced Placement Computer Science A courses, but not necessarily AP CS Principles courses). Either CS 1101 or CS 1102 provides sufficient background for further courses in the CS department. Undergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and CS 1101.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1102\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
