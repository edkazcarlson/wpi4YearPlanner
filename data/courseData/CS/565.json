"{\"Course Name\": \"USER MODELING\", \"Course Level\": \"565\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"User modeling is a cross-disciplinary research \\nfield that attempts to construct models of human \\nbehavior within a specific computer environment. \\nContrary to traditional artificial intelligence \\nresearch, the goal is not to imitate human \\nbehavior as such, but to make the machine able to\\n understand the expectations, goals, knowledge, information\\n needs, and desires of a user in terms of\\n a specific computing environment. The computer\\nrepresentation of this information about a user is\\n called a user model, and systems that construct\\n and utilize such models are called user modeling\\n systems. A simple example of a user model would\\n be an e-commerce site which makes use of the\\n user\\u2019s and similar users\\u2019 purchasing and browsing\\n behavior in order to better understand the user\\u2019s\\npreferences. In this class, the focus is on obtaining \\na general understanding of user modeling, and \\nan understanding of how to apply user modeling \\ntechniques. Students will read seminal papers in \\nthe user modeling literature, as well as complete a \\ncourse project where students build a system that \\nexplicitly models the user.
