"{\"Course Name\": \"OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN CONCEPTS\", \"Course Level\": \"2102\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThis course introduces students to an object-oriented model of programming.\\nBuilding from the design methodology covered in CS 1101/CS 1102, this \\ncourse shows how programs can be decomposed into classes and objects. By\\n emphasizing design, this course shows how to implement small defect-free\\nprograms and evaluate design decisions to select an optimal design under specific\\nassumptions. Topics include inheritance, exceptions, interface, design by \\ncontract, basic design patterns, and reuse. Students will be expected to design,\\nimplement, and debug object-oriented programs composed of multiple classes\\nand over a variety of data structures.\\n\\nRecommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1102\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
