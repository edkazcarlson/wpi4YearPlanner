"{\"Course Name\": \"DESIGN OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"509\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces students to a methodology \\nand specific design techniques for team-based development\\n of a software system. Against the back-drop \\nof the software engineering life-cycle, this\\n course focuses on the object-oriented paradigm \\nand its supporting processes and tools. Students\\n will be exposed to industrial-accepted standards \\nand tools, such as requirements elicitation,\\n specification, modeling notations, design patterns,\\n software architecture, integrated development environments\\n and testing frameworks. Students will\\n be expected to work together in teams in the complete\\nspecification, implementation and testing of\\n a software application. Prerequisites: knowledge of\\n a recursive high-level language and data structures. \\nAn undergraduate course in software engineering \\nis desirable.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
