"{\"Course Name\": \"COMPUTER NETWORKS\", \"Course Level\": \"3516\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I \\nThis course provides a broad view of computer networks. The course exposes students to all seven layers of OSI Reference Model while providing an introduction into newer topics such as wireless networking and Internet traffic concerns. The objective is to focus on an understanding of fundamental concepts of modern computer network architecture from a design and performance perspective. Topics covered include: physical layer considerations, network protocols, wide area networks, local area networks, wireless networks, switches and routing, congestion, Internet traffic and network security. Students will be expected to do extensive systems/network programming and will be expected to make use of simulation and measurement tools to gain an appreciation of current network design and performance issues. \\nThis course is also highly recommended for RBE and IMGD majors. \\nRecommended background: CS 2301 or CS 2303, or a significant knowledge of C/C++.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"2301\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2303\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
