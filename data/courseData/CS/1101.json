Topics include the design, implementation and testing of programs that use a variety of data structures (such as structures, lists, and trees), functions, conditionals, recursion and higher-\\u00ad\\u2010order functions. Students will be expected to design simple data models, and implement and debug programs in a functional programming language. \\n     Recommended background: none. \\nEither CS 1101 or CS 1102 provides sufficient background for further courses in the CS department. Undergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and CS 1102.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1102\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1102\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
