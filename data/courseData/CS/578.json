"{\"Course Name\": \"CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY\", \"Course Level\": \"578\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"This course gives a comprehensive introduction \\nto the field of cryptography and data security.\\n The course begins with the introduction of \\nthe concepts of data security, where classical\\n algorithms serve as an example. Different attacks\\n on cryptographic systems are classified. Some \\npseudo-random generators are introduced. The \\nconcepts of public and private key cryptography\\n are developed. As important representatives for\\nsecret key schemes, DES and IDEA are described.\\n The public key schemes RSA and ElGamal, and\\n systems based on elliptic curves are then developed.\\n Signature algorithms, hash functions, key\\n distribution and identification schemes are treated\\n as advanced topics. Some advanced mathematical\\n algorithms for attacking cryptographic schemes \\nare discussed. Application examples will include\\n a protocol for security in a LAN and a secure\\nsmart card system for electronic banking. Special\\n consideration will be given to schemes which\\n are relevant for network environments. For all\\n schemes, implementation aspects and up-to-date\\n security estimations will be discussed. (Prerequisites:\\n Working knowledge of C; an interest in\\n discrete mathematics and algorithms is highly \\ndesirable. Students interested in a further study of\\n the underlying mathematics may register for MA\\n 4891 [B term], where topics in modern algebra \\nrelevant to cryptography will be treated.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
