"{\"Course Name\": \"INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING FOR NON-MAJORS\", \"Course Level\": \"1004\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThis course introduces students to the fundamental principles of\\nprogramming in imperative and scripting languages. Topics include control\\nstructures, iterators, functional decomposition, basic data structures (such\\nas records). Students will be expected to implement, test and debug\\nprograms. Through the use of compelling applications and lab exercises,\\nstudents will learn how to interface with external data systems and control\\ndevices.\\n     Recommended background: none.\\n\\nAll Computer Science students and other students wishing to prepare for\\n3000-level courses in Computer Science should take CS 1101/1102\\ninstead of CS 1004. This course provides sufficient background for CS\\n2301 Systems Programming for Non-Majors.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1004\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2301\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
