I\\nThis course introduces the C programming language and system programming\\nconcepts to non-CS majors who need to program computers in their own fields.\\nThe course assumes that students have had previous programming experience. It\\nquickly introduces the major concepts of the C language and covers manual\\nmemory management, pointers and basic data structures, the machine stack,\\nand input/output mechanisms. Students will be expected to design, implement,\\nand debug programs in C. \\n     Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102 or previous experience\\nprogramming a computer. \\n\\nAll Computer Science students and other students\\n wishing to prepare for upper-level courses in Computer Science should take\\n CS 2303 instead of CS 2301. Students who have credit for CS 2303 may not \\nreceive subsequent credit for CS 2301.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1102\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2303\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2301\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2303\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2301\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
