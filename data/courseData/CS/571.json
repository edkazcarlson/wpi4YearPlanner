"{\"Course Name\": \"CASE STUDIES IN COMPUTER SECURITY\", \"Course Level\": \"571\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"This course examines security challenges and \\nfailures holistically, taking into account technical\\n concerns, human behavior, and business decisions.\\n Using a series of detailed case studies, students will \\nexplore the interplay among these dimensions in \\ncreating secure computing systems and infrastructure. \\nStudents will also apply lessons from the\\ncase studies to emerging secure-systems design \\nproblems. The course requires active participation \\nin class discussions, presentations, and writing\\n assignments. It does not involve programming, \\nbut assumes that students have substantial prior \\nexperience with security protocols, attacks, and \\nmitigations at the implementation level. This\\n course satisfies the behavioral component of the\\n MS specialization in computer security. (Prerequisites:\\n A prior course or equivalent experience in \\ntechnical aspects of computer security, at either \\nthe software or systems level.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
