"{\"Course Name\": \"ACCELERATED OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN CONCEPTS\", \"Course Level\": \"2103\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"This course covers the data structures and general program-design material from CS2102, but assumes that students have significant prior experience in object-oriented programming. The course covers object-oriented design principles and data structures more deeply and at a faster pace than in CS 2102. Students will be expected to design, implement, test, debug, and critique programs both for correctness and adherence to good object-oriented design principles. The course is designed to strengthen both the design skills and algorithmic thinking of students who already have a foundation in object-oriented programming. Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102 and significant prior experience writing object-oriented programs from scratch. Advanced Placement Computer Science A courses should provide sufficient background; students from AP CS Principles courses or gentler introductions to Java Programming are advised to take CS2102 instead. Students may receive credit for only one of the following three courses: CS 2102, CS 210X, CS 2103.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1102\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2102\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2102\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"210X\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2103\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
