"{\"Course Name\": \"SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS\", \"Course Level\": \"2303\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThis course introduces students to a model of programming where the\\nprogramming language exposes details of how the hardware stores and executes\\nsoftware. Building from the design concepts covered in CS 2102, this course \\ncovers manual memory management, pointers, the machine stack, and input/\\noutput mechanisms. The course will involve large-scale programming exercises\\n and will be designed to help students confront issues of safe programming with\\nsystem-level constructs. The course will cover several tools that assist programmers \\nin these tasks. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug \\nprograms in C++ and C. The course presents the material from CS 2301 at a \\nfast pace and also includes C++ and other advanced topics.\\n\\nRecommended background: CS 2102 and/or substantial object-oriented\\nprogramming experience.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CS\"], [\"2102\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
