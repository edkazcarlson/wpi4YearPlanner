{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAM DESIGN", "level": "1101", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "This course introduces principles of computation and programming with an emphasis on program design. Topics include the design, implementation and testing of programs that use a variety of data structures (such as structures, lists, and trees), functions, conditionals, recursion and higher-\u00ad\u2010order functions. Students will be expected to design simple data models, and implement and debug programs in a functional programming language. \n     Recommended background: none. \nEither CS 1101 or CS 1102 provides sufficient background for further courses in the CS department. Undergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and CS 1102.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
