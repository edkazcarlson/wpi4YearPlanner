"{\"title\": \"SCALE UP OF BIOPROCESSING\", \"level\": \"509\", \"abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"description\": \"(3 Credits)\\nStrategies for optimization of bioprocesses for scale-up applications will be explored. In addition \\nto the theory of scaling up unit operations in bioprocessing, students will scale up \\na bench-scale bioprocess (5 liters) including fermentation and downstream\\n processing to 55 liters. Specific topics include the effects of scaling-up on: mass\\ntransfer and bioreactor design, harvesting techniques including tangential flow\\n filtration and centrifugation, and chromatography (open column and HPLC).\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
