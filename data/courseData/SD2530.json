{"title": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODELING", "level": "2530", "abbreviation": "SD", "description": "ISP Only\n This course will focus on advanced issues and topics in system dynamics\ncomputer simulation modeling. A variety of options for dealing with complexity \nthrough the development of models of large-scale systems and the partitioning\n complex problems will be discussed. Topics will include an extended discussion \nof model analysis, the use of summary statistics and sensitivity measures, the \nmodel validation process, and policy design. The application of system Dynamics \nto theory building and social policy are also reviewed. Complex nonlinear\n dynamics and the chaotic behavior of systems will be discussed. Students will be\n assigned group exercises centering on model analysis and policy design.\n Recommended background: SD 1520.", "req": [[["SD"], ["1520"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
