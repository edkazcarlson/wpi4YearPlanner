"{\"Course Name\": \"GEOMETRICAL CONCEPTS\", \"Course Level\": \"518\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MME\", \"Course Description\": \"This course focuses primarily on the foundations\\n and applications of Euclidean and non-Euclidean\\ngeometries. The rich and diverse nature of the\\n subject also implies the need to explore other \\ntopics, for example, chaos and fractals. The course\\n incorporates collaborative learning and the investigation \\nof ideas through group projects. Possible \\ntopics include geometrical software and computer\\n graphics, tiling and tessellations, two- and three dimensional\\n geometry, inversive geometry, graphical\\nrepresentations of functions, model construction, \\nfundamental relationship between algebra \\nand geometry, applications of geometry, geometry \\ntransformations and projective geometry, and \\nconvexity.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
