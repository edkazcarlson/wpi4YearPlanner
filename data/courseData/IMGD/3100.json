"{\"Course Name\": \"NOVEL INTERFACES FOR INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\", \"Course Level\": \"3100\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"IMGD\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis course focuses on the design and evaluation of novel user interfaces that\\nprovide greater input and output expressiveness than the keyboard, mouse, or \\ngame pad. The course covers the related applications of immersive gaming,\\n teleoperated robotics, and mobile users. Input sensors, such as those providing \\nmotion, attitude, and pressure data, are used to explore novel input methods,\\n and how they may be effectively used to design innovative experiences. Through \\na combination of lecture and hands-on work, students learn to build prototype \\nsystems and to critically evaluate different alternatives. Students are expected to \\nprogram several alternative input/output systems as part of this course. \\n \\n     Recommended Background: IMGD 1001, and either CS 2301 or CS 2303\\n.\\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2015\"}"
