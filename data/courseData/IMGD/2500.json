One two-hour laboratory a week covers play, and\\n playtesting, and supports the game design project.\\n \\n     Recommended background: IMGD 1000\\n.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"IMGD\"], [\"1000\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
