"{\"Course Name\": \"3D ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING\", \"Course Level\": \"2740\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"IMGD\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II The objective of this course is to teach students how to create 3D environments and props for use in digital models, simulations, games, or animation. The course will examine different types of architecture used in 3D spaces. The students will learn how to create historical and fictional interior and exterior environments; to design, model, texture, and render in high details; and to import their creation into an engine for testing. Topics may include space, human scale, set design, surface texturing, and basic camera animation. Students may not receive credit for IMGD/AR 2740 and IMGD/AR 205X.\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended Background: Basic 3D modeling skills (AR 1101)\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
