II\\nAdvanced software design and programming techniques from artificial intelligence are key contributors to the experience of modern computer games and virtual environments, either by directly controlling a non-player character or through more subtle  manipulation of environment. This course will cover the current state of the art in the area, as well as prepare students for the next generation of AI contributions. We will study the application of AI techniques such as search, planning, machine learning, emotion modeling and natural language processing, to game problems such as navigations, strategy, believability and narrative control. Students will implement several small AI demonstration games.\\nRecommended background: IMGD 4000\\nStudents may not receive credit for both IMGD 4100 and IMGD 400X.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"IMGD\"], [\"4000\"]], [[\"IMGD\"], [\"4100\"]], [[\"IMGD\"], [\"400X\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
