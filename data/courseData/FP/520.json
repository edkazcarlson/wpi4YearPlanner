"{\"Course Name\": \"FIRE MODELING\", \"Course Level\": \"520\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"FP\", \"Course Description\": \"Modeling of compartment fire behavior is studied through the use and application of two types of models: zone and field. The zone model studied is CFAST. The field model studied is FDS. Focus on in-depth understanding of each of these models is the primary objective in terms of needed input, equations solved, interpretation of output and limitations. Additional fundamental understanding of fire models is gained via a student developed model. A working student model is required for successful completion of the course. Basic computational ability is assumed. Basic numerical methods are used and can be learned during the course via independent study. (Prerequisite: FP 521 or permission of the instructor.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
