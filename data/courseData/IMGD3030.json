Students will also gain deeper insight into 2-D vs. 3-D audio propagation, as well as learn more complex techniques in digital editing, mixing, signal processing, mastering, and playback strategies. Lab exercises may include interactive dialogue scripting and recording; loop-based music production; custom sound effects creation and Foley design; and audio engine integration. A team project will be the creation of a comprehensive game sound effects library over the course of the term.\n     Recommended background: Game Audio (IMGD 2030)", "req": [[["IMGD"], ["2030"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
