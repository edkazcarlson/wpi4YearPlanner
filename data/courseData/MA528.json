"{\"title\": \"MEASURE THEORETIC PROBABILITY THEORY\", \"level\": \"528\", \"abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"description\": \"This course is designed to give graduate students interested in financial mathematics and stochastic analysis the necessary background in measuretheoretic probability and provide a theoretical foundation for Ph.D. students with research interests in analysis and mathematical statistics. Besides classical topics such as the axiomatic foundations of probability, conditional probabilities and independence, random variables and their distributions, and limit theorems, this course focuses on concepts crucial for the understanding of stochastic processes and quantitative finance: conditional expectations, filtrations and martingales as well as change of measure techniques and the Radon-Nikodym theorem. A wide range of illustrative examples from a topic chosen by the instructor\\u2019s discretion (e.g financial mathematics, signal processing, actuarial mathematics) will be presented. (Prerequisite:MA500 Basic Real Analysis or equivalent.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
