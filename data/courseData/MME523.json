"{\"title\": \"ANALYSIS WITH APPLICATIONS\", \"level\": \"523\", \"abbreviation\": \"MME\", \"description\": \"This course introduces students to mathematical\\n analysis and its use in modeling. It will emphasize\\ntopics of calculus (including multidimensional)\\n in a rigorous way. These topics will be motivated\\n by their usefulness for understanding concepts of \\nthe calculus and for facilitating the solutions of\\nengineering and science problems. Projects involving \\napplications and appropriate use of technology\\nwill be an essential part of the course. Topics \\ncovered may include dynamical systems and differential\\nequations; growth and decay; equilibrium; \\nprobabilistic dynamics; optimal decisions and\\n reward; applying, building and validating models;\\n functions on n-vectors; properties of functions; \\nparametric equations; series; applications such as\\n pendulum problems; electromagnetism; vibrations; \\nelectronics; transportation; gravitational \\nfields; and heat loss.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
