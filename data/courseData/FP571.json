{"title": "PERFORMANCE-BASED DESIGN", "level": "571", "abbreviation": "FP", "description": "This course covers practical applications of fire protection engineering principles to the design of buildings. Both compartmented and noncompartmented buildings will be designed for criteria of life safety, property protection, continuity of operations, operational management and cost. Modern analytical tools as well as traditional codes and standards are utilized. Interaction with architects and code officials, and an awareness of other factors in the building design process are incorporated through design exercises and a design studio.
