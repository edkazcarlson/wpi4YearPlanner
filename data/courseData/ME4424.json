"{\"title\": \"RADIATION HEAT TRANSFER APPLICATION AND DESIGN.\", \"level\": \"4424\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"Cat. II Radiation Heat Transfer Applications will develop the student\\u2019s knowledge of radiation and multi-mode heat transfer. Fundamentals of radiation will be covered: radiative properties of surfaces; view factors; exchange between black and grey surfaces; emission and absorption of gases; and flame radiation. Use of numerical methods will be emphasized as appropriate for solution of applications: the select numerical methods (numerical integration, matrix methods, ODE solutions) can be learned during the course. The course will conclude with a design exercise to be completed by each student. Each exercise will highlight radiation in a realistic scenario that requires multi-mode heat transfer and fluid mechanics analysis to develop the design solution. Exercise topics will come from subjects such as: solar power plants, solar effects on buildings, furnaces, fire safety in the built environment, etc. Recommended background: differential and integral calculus, and ordinary differential equations (MA 2051 or equivalent), and thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer (ES 3001, 3004, 3003 or equivalents). Students may not receive credit for both ME 4424 and ME 442X. This course will be offered in 2020-21, and in alternating years thereafter.\\r\\n\", \"req\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3001\"]], [[\"ME\"], [\"4424\"]], [[\"ME\"], [\"442X\"]]], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": \"2020\"}"
