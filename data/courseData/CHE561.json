"{\"title\": \"THERMODYNAMICS\", \"level\": \"561\", \"abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"description\": \"Thermodynamics is at the heart of many systems of interest to chemical engineers, from the efficiency of simple mechanical processes to the equilibria of complex reactions. This course is a rigorous treatment of classical thermodynamics, with reference to the field of statistical thermodynamics. Key modules include First and Second Law analysis; behavior and interrelationships of thermodynamic properties; and fluid phase and chemical equilibria. Example topics may include analysis of open and dynamic systems; fundamental relationships; Legendre transforms and generalized potentials; Maxwell relationships; stability theory; thermodynamics of mixtures; fugacity, activity, and chemical potential; phase equilibria of systems containing two or more components; and generalized treatment of chemical equilibria.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
