"{\"title\": \"TRANSPORT PHENOMENA\", \"level\": \"571\", \"abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"description\": \"Transport rates of mass, energy, and momentum are key to the design of many chemical technologies. This class adopts a unified approach to transport phenomena, providing the fundamental background required for analysis of complex problems. Students will use mathematical techniques for analytic and approximate solutions such as: separation of variables, similarity solutions, perturbation theory, and Laplace and Fourier transform methods. Methods involving non-dimensionalization and scaling will be emphasized. Special problems to be covered may include the lubrication approximation, creeping flow, and potential and laminar boundary-layer flows, as well as heat and mass transport in multi-component systems. Students are expected to have taken previous courses on transport processes and have mathematical background that includes solution of differential equations.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
