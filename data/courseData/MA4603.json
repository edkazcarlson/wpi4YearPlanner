{"title": "STATISTICAL METHODS IN GENETICS AND BIOINFORMATICS", "level": "4603", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Cat. II\nThis course provides students with knowledge and understanding of the\napplications of statistics in modern genetics and bioinformatics. The course\n generally covers population genetics, genetic epidemiology, and statistical models \nin bioinformatics. Specific topics include meiosis modeling, stochastic models \nfor recombination, linkage and association studies (parametric vs. nonparametric \nmodels, family-based vs. population-based models) for mapping genes of\n qualitative and quantitative traits, gene expression data analysis, DNA and \nprotein sequence analysis, and molecular evolution. Statistical approaches \ninclude log-likelihood ratio tests, score tests, generalized linear models, EM \nalgorithm, Markov chain Monte Carlo, hidden Markov model, and classification\n and regression trees.\n  \n     Recommended background: MA 2612, MA 2631 (or MA 2621), and one or\n more biology courses.\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
