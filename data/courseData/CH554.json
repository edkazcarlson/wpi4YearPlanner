"{\"title\": \"MOLECULAR MODELING\", \"level\": \"554\", \"abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"description\": \"This course trains students in the area of molecular\\n modeling using a variety of quantum mechanical\\n and force field methods. The approach will be \\ntoward practical applications, for researchers who \\nwant to answer specific questions about molecular\\n geometry, transition states, reaction paths and\\n photoexcited states. No experience in programming\\nis necessary; however, a backround at the \\nintroductory level in quantum mechanics is highly\\n desirable. Methods to be explored include density\\n functional theory, ab initio methods, semiempirical \\nmolecular orbital theory, and visualization \\nsoftware for the graphical display of molecules.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
