"{\"Course Name\": \"EMPIRICAL METHODS FOR HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING\", \"Course Level\": \"567\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SEME\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces students to techniques for\\n performing rigorous empirical research in computer\\n Science. Since good empirical work depends \\non asking good research questions, this course will\\n emphasize creating conceptual frameworks and using \\nthem to drive research. In addition to helping \\nstudents understand what makes a good research\\nquestion and why, some elementary statistics will\\n be covered. Furthermore, students will use and \\nimplement computationally intensive techniques \\nsuch as randomization, bootstrapping, and \\npermutation tests. The course also covers experiments\\n involving human subjects, and some of the \\nstatistical and non-statistical difficulties researchers\\noften encounter while performing such work \\n(e.g., IRB (Institutional Review Board), correlated \\ntrials, and small sample sizes). While this course \\nis designed for students in Human Computer \\nInteraction, Interactive Media and Game Development,\\n and Learning Sciences and Technologies,\\n it is appropriate for any student with programming\\n experience who is doing empirical research.\\n (Prerequisites: MA 511 Applied Statistics for Engineers\\n and Scientists or permission of the instructor.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
