I\\n \\nSoftware engineering and art production are the means of digital game\\ndevelopment, but the end is an experience. Game design is the process of \\ncreating, describing, implementing and iteratively refining that experience. This \\nteam-oriented, project-based course provides opportunities for students to \\ndevelop hands-on expertise with digital game design through a combination of \\npractical implementation, in-class critique and playtesting. A focus of the course \\nis the functional expression of design through the use of game engine scripting.\\n \\nStudents keep a weekly journal of their design experiences. A final exam tests \\ntheir knowledge of design concepts and terminology.\\nRecommended Background: Intermediate programming experience (such as from CS 2102 or CS 1004), knowledge of game studies (IMGD 1000 or equivalent) and the game development process (IMGD 1001 or equivalent).\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
