{"title": "LINEAR MODELS I", "level": "526", "abbreviation": "MME", "description": "This two-course sequence imparts computational \nskills, particularly those involving matrices, to \ndeepen understanding of mathematical structure\n and methods of proof; it also includes discussion\n on a variety of applications of the material developed, \nincluding linear optimization. Topics in this \nsequence may include systems of linear equations, \nvector spaces, linear independence, bases, linear\ntransformations, determinants, eigenvalues and\n eigenvectors, systems of linear inequalities, linear\nprogramming problems, basic solutions, duality\n and game theory. Applications may include economic\nmodels, computer graphics, least squares\n approximation, systems of differential equations,\n graphs and networks, and Markov processes.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
