Topics from sampling studies include: \\nsimple random sampling and associated estimates for means, totals, and proportions; estimates for\\n subpopulations; unequal probability sampling;\\n ratio and regression estimation; stratified, cluster,\\n systematic, multistage, double sampling designs,\\n and, time permitting, topics such as model-based\\n sampling, spatial and adaptive sampling. \\n(Prerequisite: knowledge of basic probability and\\n statistics, at the level of MA 511 is assumed.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
