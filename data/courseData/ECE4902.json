{"title": "ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN", "level": "4902", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "Cat. II\nThis course introduces students to the design and analysis of analog integrated\ncircuits such as operational amplifiers, phase-locked loops, and analog multipliers.\n Topics: integrated circuit building blocks: current mirrors and sources,\n differential amplifiers, voltage references and multipliers, output circuits.\n Computer-aided simulation of circuits. Layout of integrated circuits. Design and \nanalysis of such circuits as operational amplifiers, phase-locked loops, FM\n detectors, and analog multipliers. Laboratory exercises.\n\nRecommended background: familiarity with the analysis of linear circuits and\n with the theory of bipolar and MOSFET transistors. Such skills are typically\n acquired in ECE 3204.\nSuggested background: ECE 4904.\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2015"}
