"{\"title\": \"EXPERIMENTAL GENETIC ENGINEERING\", \"level\": \"4170\", \"abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis laboratory course focuses on modern DNA technologies and general applications of gene manipulation. Topics include gene amplification and recombination, promoter and plasmid engineering, gene expression and analysis, model systems, CRISPR, genomics and transgenics. Experiments in this course are integrated into an overall genetic engineering project throughout the term that will involve techniques such as electrophoresis, quantitative spectrofluorimetry, and real-time quantitative PCR. Methods of data analysis, common statistical approaches and technical writing will be emphasized throughout the course. \\n  Recommended background: Knowledge of organic chemistry fundamentals as well as biochemical concepts including DNA replication and recombination, RNA synthesis and protein synthesis.  Familiarity with cellular architecture is also recommended.  See CH2310, BB2550, BB4010 and CH4110 or equivalent.\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"2310\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"4010\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"4110\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
