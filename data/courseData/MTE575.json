"{\"title\": \"INTRODUCTION TO NANOMATERIALS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY\", \"level\": \"575\", \"abbreviation\": \"MTE\", \"description\": \"This course introduces students to current developments \\nin nanoscale science and technology. The \\ncurrent advance of materials and devices constituting\\n of building blocks of metals, semiconductors,\\n ceramics or polymers that are nanometer size (1-\\n100 nm) are reviewed. The profound implications \\nfor technology and science of this research field \\nare discussed. The differences of the properties of \\nmatter on the nanometer scale from those on the\\n macroscopic scale due to the size confinement,\\n predominance of interfacial phenomena and \\nquantum mechanics are studied. The main issues\\n and techniques relevant to science and technologies \\non the nanometer scale are considered. New\\ndevelopments in this field and future perspectives \\nare presented. Topics covered include: fabrication\\n of nanoscale structures, characterization at\\n nanoscale, molecular electronics, nanoscale mechanics, \\nnew architecture, nano-optics and societal\\n impacts.
