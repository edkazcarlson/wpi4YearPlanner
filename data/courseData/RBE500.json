{"title": "FOUNDATIONS OF ROBOTICS", "level": "500", "abbreviation": "RBE", "description": "Mathematical foundations and principles of\n processing sensor information in robotic systems.\n Topics include an introduction to probabilistic \nconcepts related to sensors, sensor signal processing,\n multi-sensor control systems and optimal\n estimation. The material presented will focus on\n the types of control problems encountered when \na robot must operate in an environment where\n sensor noise and/or tracking errors are significant.\n Techniques for assessing the stability, controllability\n and expected accuracy of multi-sensor control\n and tracking systems will be presented. Lab \nprojects will involve processing live and synthetic \ndata, robot simulation, and projects involving the\n control of robot platforms. (Prerequisites: Differential\n Equations (MA 2051 or equivalent), Linear\n Algebra (MA 2071 or equivalent) and the ability \nto program in a high-level language.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
