"{\"title\": \"PHOTONICS LABORATORY\", \"level\": \"2601\", \"abbreviation\": \"PH\", \"description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis course provides an experimental approach to concepts covered in Photonics\\n(PH 2501), Lasers (PH 2502), and Optics (PH 3504). Through a series of \\nindividually tailored experiments, students will reinforce their knowledge in one\\n or more of these areas, while at the same time gaining exposure to modern \\nphotonics laboratory equipment. Experiments available include properties of\\n optical fibers, optical fiber diagnostics, optical communications systems, \\nproperties of photodetectors, mode structure and threshold behavior of lasers, \\ncoherence properties of laser light, characterization of fiber amplifiers, diffraction \\nof light, polarization of light, interferometry.\\n     Recommended background: PH 1110/1111, PH 1120/1121. PH 1130,\\n PH 1140, and one or more of the courses PH 2501, PH 2502, or PH 3504.\\n No prior laboratory background is expected.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"req\": [[[\"PH\"], [\"1110\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1120\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1130\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1140\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"2502\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"3504\"]]], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": \"2016\"}"
