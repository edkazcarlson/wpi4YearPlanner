"{\"title\": \"X-RAY DIFFRACTION AND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY\", \"level\": \"5332\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"This course discusses the fundamentals of crystallography and X-ray diffraction (XRD) of metals, ceramics and polymers. It introduces graduate students to the main issues and techniques of diffraction analysis as they relate to materials.  The techniques for the experimental phase identification and determination of phase fraction via XRD will be reviewed. Topics covered include: basic X-ray physics, basic crystallography, fundamentals of XRD, XRD instrumentation and analysis techniques. (Prerequisites: ES 2001 or equivalent, and senior or graduate standing in engineering or science.) Note: Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics version of the same course (MTE594C).\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
