{"title": "ENERGY CHALLENGES IN THE 21st CENTURY", "level": "3702", "abbreviation": "CHE", "description": "Cat. II\nThe goal of this course is to prepare students for future work in energy-related fields by providing an overview of the challenges related to energy production. Students will study several major energy systems. The details of such energy systems will be examined using engineering principles, particularly focusing on relevant chemical processes. For example, the details and processes of a typical power plant or a refinery will be examined. Students will also become familiar with environmental and economic issues related to energy production. Topics to be covered may include: fossil fuels, the hydrogen economy, biofuels, nuclear energy, fuel cells, batteries, and the electricity grid. \n     Recommended background: knowledge of chemistry (CH 1010, 1020, 1030), differential and integral calculus, and chemical processes (CHE 2011).\n     Students may not receive credit for both CHE 3702 and CHE 320X.", "req": [[["CH"], ["1010"]], [["CHE"], ["2011"]], [["CHE"], ["3702"]], [["CHE"], ["320X"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": -1}
