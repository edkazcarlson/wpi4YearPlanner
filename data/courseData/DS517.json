"{\"title\": \"MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR DATA SCIENCE\", \"level\": \"517\", \"abbreviation\": \"DS\", \"description\": \"The foci of this class are the essential statistics and linear algebra skills required for Data Science students.  The class builds the foundation for theoretical and computational abilities of the students to analyze high dimensional data sets.   Topics covered include Bayes\\u2019 theorem, the central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, linear equations, linear transformations, matrix algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and sampling techniques, including Bootstrap and Markov chain Monte Carlo. Students will use these techniques while engaging in hands-on projects with real data. \\nPrerequisites:  Some knowledge of integral and differential calculus is recommended.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
