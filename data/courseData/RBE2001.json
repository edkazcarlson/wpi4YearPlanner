"{\"title\": \"UNIFIED ROBOTICS I\", \"level\": \"2001\", \"abbreviation\": \"RBE\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nFirst of a four-course sequence introducing foundational theory and practice of\\nrobotics engineering from the fields of computer science, electrical engineering\\n and mechanical engineering. The focus of this course is the effective conversion \\nof electrical power to mechanical power, and power transmission for purposes of \\nlocomotion, and of payload manipulation and delivery. Concepts of energy,\\n power and kinematics will be applied. Concepts from statics such as force, \\nmoments and friction will be applied to determine power system requirements \\nand structural requirements. Simple dynamics relating to inertia and the \\nequations of motion of rigid bodies will be considered. Power control and \\nmodulation methods will be introduced through software control of existing\\nembedded processors and power electronics. The necessary programming concepts and interaction with simulators and Integrated Development \\nEnvironments will be introduced. Laboratory sessions consist of hands-on \\nexercises and team projects where students design and build robots and related \\nsub-systems.\\n \\nRecommended background: ES 2201/RBE 1001, ES 2501 (can be taken\\n concurrently), ECE 2029 and PH 1120 or PH 1121.\", \"req\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"2201\"]], [[\"RBE\"], [\"1001\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2029\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1120\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1121\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
