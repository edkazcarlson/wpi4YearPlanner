"{\"title\": \"DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING\", \"level\": \"545\", \"abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"description\": \"This course presents fundamental concepts of\\n digital image processing and an introduction to \\nmachine vision. Image processing topics will include \\nvisual perception, image formation, imaging\\n geometries, image transform theory and applications,\\nenhancement, restoration, encoding and \\ncompression. Machine vision topics will include\\nfeature extraction and representation, stereo vision,\\n model-based recognition, motion and image\\n flow, and pattern recognition. Students will be \\nrequired to complete programming assignments \\nin a high-level language. (Prerequisites: working \\nknowledge of undergraduate level signal analysis \\nand linear algebra; familiarity with probability \\ntheory is helpful but not necessary.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
