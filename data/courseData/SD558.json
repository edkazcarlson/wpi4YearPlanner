"{\"title\": \"INTRODUCTION TO AGENT-BASED MODELING\", \"level\": \"558\", \"abbreviation\": \"SD\", \"description\": \"The purpose of this course is to provide students \\nwith an introduction to the field of agent-based \\ncomputer simulation modeling in the social sciences.\\n The course begins with an outline of the \\nhistory of the field, as well as of the similarities \\nand differences between agent-based computer \\nsimulation modeling and system dynamics computer\\n simulation modeling. An important goal of \\nthe course is to provide students with guidelines \\nfor deciding when it is preferable to apply agent-based\\n modeling, and when it is preferable to\\n apply system dynamics modeling, to a particular\\n problem. Through a series of example models and\\n homework exercises students are introduced to \\nthe software that is used in the course. Generally\\n speaking, as the course progresses students will be \\nintroduced to increasingly complicated agent-based \\nmodels and exercises so that their modeling\\n skills will grow. The goal is to increase students\\u2019\\n modeling skills so that they will eventually be \\nable to create their own agent-based models from\\n scratch. The remainder of the course is devoted \\nto examining models of socioeconomic phenomena\\n that reside within two broad categories of\\n agent-based models: cellular automata models and \\nmulti-agent models. Along the way the cross-category, \\ncross-disciplinary, principles of agent-based \\nmodeling (micro-level agents following simple \\nrules leading to macro-level complexity, adaptation,\\n evolving structure, emergence, non-ergodicity)\\n are emphasized.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
