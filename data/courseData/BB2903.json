{"title": "ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY", "level": "2903", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "Cat. I (1/6 unit)\nThis course is an active exploration of a number of topics in anatomy and physiology through the use of simulations, measurement and hands on discovery.  It will be particularly relevant to any student considering a heath related career, doing work where body structure is relevant or  has interest in how body systems connect. A significant portion of this discovery will be accomplished by a hands-on dissection.  Examples of the specific types of techniques and experiences included in this course are:\n\u2022\tComparative and general anatomy of several organisms\n\u2022\tPhysiology and function of body systems, processes and organs.\n\u2022\tEnzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\n\u2022\tMicroscopy\n\nRecommended background: BB 1025 (Human Biology) or equivalent", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
