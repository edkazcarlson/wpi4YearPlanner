"{\"Course Name\": \"PROTEIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\", \"Course Level\": \"4110\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\nThe fundamental concepts of protein architecture and dynamics are presented with an emphasis on the functional outcomes of chemistry coordinated in three dimensional space.  Catalytic mechanics and enzyme function are outlined in detail.  Current methods in the determination of enzyme structure and function will be discussed, and students will use common tools in macromolecular analysis and structural modeling.  Case studies in enzyme dysfunction, disease, and current research will be used throughout the course.\\n  Recommended background: Familiarity with organic chemistry topics including functional groups, nucleophilic addition and substitution reactions, stereochemistry, and carbonyl chemistry.  General knowledge of cellular architecture is also recommended.  See CH 2310, CH 2320, CH 2330, and BB2550 or equivalent.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"2310\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2320\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2330\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
