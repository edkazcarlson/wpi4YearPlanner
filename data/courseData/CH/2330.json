"{\"Course Name\": \"ORGANIC CHEMISTRY III\", \"Course Level\": \"2330\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course fully explores three most important analytical methods in organic\\nchemistry: infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic\\n resonance spectroscopy. It will continue the coverage of aromatic chemistry. \\nNew topics to be introduced include structures, properties, and reactivities of \\naldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acids and their derivatives, amines, and the\\n interaction among polyfunctional compounds. It reinforces the retrosynthetic\\n analysis and multistep synthesis of organic compounds and revisits reaction \\nmechanisms and stereochemistry of all the new functional groups studied. \\n\\nRecommended background: CH2310 and CH2320. The course is intended \\nfor biochemists, chemists, chemical engineers and bioscience majors.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"2310\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2320\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
