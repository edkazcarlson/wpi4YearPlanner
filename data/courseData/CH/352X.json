"{\"Course Name\": \"FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLYING MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY\", \"Course Level\": \"352X\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"Course Description\": \"In this course, selected mathematical methods (such as group theory, Fourier transform, and integration techniques) are used to solve problems in chemistry and biochemistry. The emphasis is not on complete coverage of any specific traditional teaching subject, but rather on the ways each technique can be applied in more than one direction. The main focus is placed on problems relevant in such generally important areas as kinetics and spectroscopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended background: Chemical Thermodynamics and Calculus I \\u2013 IV or equivalent courses.\\r\\n\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
