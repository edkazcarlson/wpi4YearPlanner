"{\"Course Name\": \"ELLUCIDATION OF ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISMS\", \"Course Level\": \"544\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"Course Description\": \"In this advanced course, students will develop skill sets to independently understand, explain, and predict reactions of organic molecules. Principles of modern physical organic chemistry, such as bonding, hybridization, molecular orbital theory, non-covalent interactions, stereochemistry, and conformational analysis, will be introduced alongside experimental techniques related to thermodynamics and kinetics to provide scientists with tools to understand existing reaction pathways and study new reactions. The interplay between mechanistic hypotheses and experimental observations will be demonstrated using case studies from the primary literature. Recommended for graduate students and undergraduates who have completed the sequence in organic chemistry (CH2310, CH2320, and CH2330).\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
