"{\"title\": \"COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND DESIGN\", \"level\": \"4801\", \"abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"description\": \"Cat. I \\nThis course focuses on the computer organization and architectural design of\\nstandalone embedded and high-performance microprocessor systems. This course covers performance metrics, machine level representation of information, the assembly level interface, memory system organization and architecture, computer input/output,instruction set architecture (ISA) design, single cycle and multicycle CPU datapath and controlpath design as well as more advanced level topics such as pipelining, interrupts, cache and memory system design. Special attention will be paid into measuring architectural performance and into improving computer architectures at various levels of the design hierarchy to reach optimal performance. The course will include several hands-on projects and laboratory components where students will be required to perform simulations of CPU designs using architectural simulation tools such as MIPS Simulators and SimpleScalar. \\nRecommended Background: ECE 3849. \\nSuggested Background: ECE 3829.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
