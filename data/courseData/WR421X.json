{"title": "MEDICAL WRITING", "level": "421X", "abbreviation": "WR", "description": "Medical Writing will provide students with advanced opportunities to create scientific documents characterizing disease, treatment, and medical research. Students will learn how to develop, structure, and present medical reports that integrate anatomy and pathophysiology, disease history including associated human and environmental factors, epidemiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, relevant diagnostic tests, treatments, and long and short term prognosis. The course will operate as a series of student projects in which students create scientific documents from major disease categories. \nRecommended background: Two courses in professional writing in which students have translated scientific writing for diverse audiences and have practiced designing and writing technical, scientific, or policy documents (e.g.: WR 1011, Writing about Science & Technology; WR 3210, Technical Writing; WR 3214, Writing about Disease & Public Health; WR 2310, Visual Rhetoric). Foundational life sciences courses with emphasis in anatomy and physiology are also recommended.", "req": [[["WR"], ["1011"]], [["WR"], ["3210"]], [["WR"], ["3214"]], [["WR"], ["2310"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
