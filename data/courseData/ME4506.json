I\\n \\nThis course is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of mechanical\\n vibrations, which are important for design and analysis of mechanical and \\nstructural systems subjected to time-varying loads. The objective of the course is \\nto expose the students to mathematical modeling and analysis of such systems\\n. \\nTopics covered include: formulation of the equations of motion using \\nNewton's Laws, D'Alembert's Principle and energy methods; prediction of \\nnatural frequency for single-degree-of-freedom systems; modeling stiffness \\ncharacteristics, damping and other vibrational properties of mechanical systems; basic solution techniques by frequency response analysis and convolution \\nintegral methods. Examples may include analysis and design for transient \\npassage through resonance; analysis and design of vibration measurement\\n devices; introductory rotordynamics. The course is mainly focused on analysis of \\nsingle-degree-of-freedom systems, however a basic introduction into multidegree-\\nof-freedom systems is also presented. Computer-based project may be \\nsuggested.\\n \\nRecommended background: Ordinary Differential Equations (MA 2501),\\n Statics (ES 2501), Dynamics (ES 2503).\", \"req\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2503\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
