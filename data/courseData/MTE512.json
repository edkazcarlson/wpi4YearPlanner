{"title": "PROPERTIES AND PERFORMANCE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS", "level": "512", "abbreviation": "MTE", "description": "The two introductory classes on materials science (MTE511 and MTE512) describe the structure-property relationships in materials.  In MTE511, the principal structural parameters in metals, ceramics, glasses and plastics were highlighted.  The effects of processing on the structure were also discussed.  The purpose of this class is to provide a basic knowledge of the principles pertaining to the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of materials.  The primary focus of this class will be on mechanical properties.  The thermal, tensile, compressive, flexural and shear properties of metallic alloys, ceramics and glasses and plastics will be discussed.  Fundamental aspects of fracture mechanics and viscoelasticity will be presented.  An overview of dynamic properties such as fatigue, impact and creep will be provided.  The relationship between the structural parameters and the preceding mechanical properties will be described.  Basic composite theories will be presented to describe fiber-reinforced composites and nanocomposites. Various factors associated with material degradation during use will be discussed.  Some introductory definitions of electrical and optical properties will be outlined.  (Prerequisites: senior or graduate standing or consent of the instructor.) Note:  Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics version of the same course (MTE594P).", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
