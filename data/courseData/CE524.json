"{\"title\": \"FINITE ELEMENT METHOD AND APPLICATIONS\", \"level\": \"524\", \"abbreviation\": \"CE\", \"description\": \"This course serves as an introduction to the basic \\ntheory of the finite element method. Topics \\ncovered include matrix structural analysis variation \\nform of differential equations, Ritz and weighted\\n residual approximations, and development of\\n the discretized domain solution. Techniques are\\n developed in detail for the one- and two-dimensional\\n equilibrium problem. Examples focus on\\nelasticity and heat flow with reference to broader\\napplications. Students are supplied microcomputer\\n programs and gain experience in solving real \\nproblems. (Prerequisites: Elementary differential\\n equations, solid mechanics and heat flow. Note:\\n Students cannot receive credit for both this \\ncourse and CE/ME 5303 Applied Finite Element \\nMethods.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
