{"title": "TRANSPORT & TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENT", "level": "4063", "abbreviation": "CHE", "description": "Cat. II\nIn this course, students will learn to make quantitative relationships between \nhuman activities and the effects on water, soil, and air in the environment.\n Students will learn the scientific and engineering principles that are needed to\n understand how contaminants enter and move in the environment, how \ncompounds react in the environment, how to predict their concentrations in the\n environment, and how to develop solutions to environmental problems.\n Topics to be covered may include water quality engineering (including \nmicrobial interactions), air quality engineering, and hazardous waste \nmanagement.\n \n\nRecommended Background: familiarity with transport phenomena, such as in \nES 3004 (Fluid Mechanics) and ES 3002 (Mass Transfer), and familiarity with \nreaction kinetics and reactor design, such as through CHE 3201 (Kinetics and \nReactor Design). Background such as CE 3059 (Environmental Engineering),\n CE 3060 (Water Treatment), or CE 3061 (Wastewater Treatment) is suggested.\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
