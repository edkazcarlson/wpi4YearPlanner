In this course a \\nbasic introduction to mechanical vibration is also discussed. Basic equations will\\n be developed with respect to translating and rotating coordinate systems.\\n \\nRecommended background: Statics (ES 2501 or CE 2000).\", \"req\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"CE\"], [\"2000\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
