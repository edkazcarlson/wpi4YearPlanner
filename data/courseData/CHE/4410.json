"{\"Course Name\": \"CHEMICAL PROCESS SAFETY DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"4410\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"Course Description\": \"Application of chemical engineering design principles to the design of the process safety and environmental controls of a major chemical plant. Students work in groups to produce a preliminary practical flowsheet, equipment design and controls, and economic analysis, all associated with chemical process safety components within a plant. The course will also include an introduction to modeling of off-site impacts.\\n   Recommended background: familiarity with techniques and procedures of chemical engineering design (CHE 4403), working knowledge of thermodynamics, heat, mass and momentum transfer, inorganic and organic chemistry, chemical kinetics and reactor design.\\n   This course meets the requirements for a core course and a Capstone Design course in chemical engineering. Students may not receive core credit for both CHE 4404 and CHE 4410.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CHE\"], [\"4403\"]], [[\"CHE\"], [\"4404\"]], [[\"CHE\"], [\"4410\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
