"{\"Course Name\": \"CHEMICAL PROCESS DYNAMICS AND CONTROL LABORATORY\", \"Course Level\": \"4405\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course is intended to provide laboratory application of fundamental principles\\nof chemical process dynamics and feedback control. This includes open-loop\\n dynamics of typical chemical engineering processes such as distillation, fluid flow, \\nchemical reactors and heated stirred tanks. Closed-loop experiments will involve \\ncontrol loop design, controller tuning, multivariable, and computer control.\\n \\nStudents will be required to design and execute their own experiments based \\non supplied objectives. Analysis and presentation of the results will be done\\n through oral and written reports.\\n \\nRecommended background: knowledge of fluid flow and heat transfer,\\n mathematics and chemical engineering principles.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
