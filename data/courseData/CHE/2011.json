"{\"Course Name\": \"CHEMICAL ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALS\", \"Course Level\": \"2011\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I \\nThis first course in chemical engineering is designed to give students the ability\\n to use techniques and solve problems of interest to chemical engineers. Students \\nwill learn fundamental material by completing analysis, design, and/or \\nlaboratory projects. Topics covered include: material balances and stoichiometry,\\n pressure, volume, and temperature behavior of pure fluids, 1st law of thermodynamics,\\n vapor-liquid equilibria with ideal thermodynamics, and staged \\nseparation processes. \\n\\nRecommended background: Elementary college chemistry and calculus.\\n \\nStudents may not receive credit towards CHE distribution requirements for \\nboth CHE 2011 and CM 2001.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"CHE\"], [\"2011\"]], [[\"CM\"], [\"2001\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
