"{\"Course Name\": \"KINETICS AND CATALYSIS*\", \"Course Level\": \"506\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"Course Description\": \"Theories of reaction kinetics and heterogeneous \\ncatalysis are developed for both simple and complex reactions.\\n The kinetics \\nand mechanisms of both catalyzed and \\nuncatalyzed reactions are explored, as well as the effects of bulk and \\npore diffusion. Techniques for experimentation,\\n reaction data treatment, and catalyst preparation\\n and characterization are related to developing a sound approach to studying a chemical reaction.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
