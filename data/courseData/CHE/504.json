"{\"Course Name\": \"MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING*\", \"Course Level\": \"504\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"Course Description\": \"An essential skill of an engineer is to provide analytical and numerical solutions to relevant problems. This course will provide students with a solid mathematical background required to solve chemical engineering problems in fields such as fluid mechanics, reactor design, thermodynamics, and process design. Methods of mathematical analysis relevant to engineering will be selected from such topics as vector analysis, matrices, eigenvalue problems, Fourier analysis, Fourier transforms, Laplace transformation, solution of ordinary and partial differential equations, integral equations, calculus of variation, optimization methods, and numerical methods. Students should have a background in undergraduate calculus and differential equations.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
