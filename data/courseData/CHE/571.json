"{\"Course Name\": \"TRANSPORT PHENOMENA\", \"Course Level\": \"571\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"CHE\", \"Course Description\": \"Transport rates of mass, energy, and momentum are key to the design of many chemical technologies. This class adopts a unified approach to transport phenomena, providing the fundamental background required for analysis of complex problems. Students will use mathematical techniques for analytic and approximate solutions such as: separation of variables, similarity solutions, perturbation theory, and Laplace and Fourier transform methods. Methods involving non-dimensionalization and scaling will be emphasized. Special problems to be covered may include the lubrication approximation, creeping flow, and potential and laminar boundary-layer flows, as well as heat and mass transport in multi-component systems. Students are expected to have taken previous courses on transport processes and have mathematical background that includes solution of differential equations.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
