{"title": "ADVANCED GAS DYNAMICS", "level": "5102", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "An introduction to kinetic theory of gases and its \napplication to equilibrium flows and flows with\nchemical, vibrational and translational nonequilibrium.\n Topics in kinetic theory also include the\nBoltzmann Equation and its relation to the continuum\n equations of gas dynamics. A major focus\n of the course is exploring how results for equilibrium\n flow of a perfect gas (e.g. flows in nozzles, \nnormal and oblique shocks, expansion waves) are \nmodified for an imperfect gas with nonequilibrium.\n The models of flow with nonequilibrium \nare then applied to the study of different flows of\n engineering interest including hypersonic flows \n(e.g. re-entry vehicles), propagating shock waves \n(explosions), and chemically reacting flows. Students \ncannot receive credit for this course if they have \ntaken the Special Topics (ME 593G) version of the \nsame course or ME 512.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
