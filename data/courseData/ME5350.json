{"title": "PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS IN MATERIALS", "level": "5350", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "This course is intended to provide a fundamental\n understanding of thermodynamic and kinetic \nprinciples associated with phase transformations.\n The mechanisms of phase transformations will be\n discussed in terms of driving forces to establish a\n theoretical background for various physical phenomena.\n The principles of nucleation and growth\n and spinodal transformations will be described.\n The theoretical analysis of diffusion controlled \nand interface controlled growth will be presented\n. The basic concepts of martensitic transformations\n will be highlighted. Specific examples will include\n solidification, crystallization, precipitation,\n sintering, phase separation and transformation\n toughening.
