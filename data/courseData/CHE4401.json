{"title": "UNIT OPERATIONS OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING I", "level": "4401", "abbreviation": "CHE", "description": "Cat. I \nLaboratory-application of fundamental theories to practical chemical engineering\noperations. Emphasis is on building the student\u2019s understanding and ability \nto approach the problems of design and operations of large scale chemical \nprocessing equipment.\nThe course is a combination of lectures and laboratory projects in the area of \nunit operations. Laboratory projects include experiments in fluid-flow\n phenomena through various media such as: friction in conduits, filtration,\n pressure drop in packed towers, fluidization of solids, and spray drying.\n \nStudents are expected to carry out the planning and execution of experimental\n work as well as the analysis and reporting of experimental results in both written\n and oral format. \nRecommended background: knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and \nengineering principles.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
