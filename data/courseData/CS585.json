{"title": "BIG DATA MANAGEMENT", "level": "585", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "Emerging applications in science and engineering disciplines generate and collect data at unprecedented speed, scale, and complexity that need to be managed and analyzed efficiently. This course introduces the emerging techniques and infrastructures developed for big data management including parallel and distributed database systems, map-reduce infrastructures, scalable platforms for complex data types, stream processing systems, and cloud-based computing. Query processing, optimization, access methods, storage layouts, and energy\nmanagement techniques developed on these infrastructures will be covered. Students are expected to engage in hands-on projects using one or more of these technologies. Prerequisites: A beginning course in databases at the level of CS4432 or equivalent knowledge, and programming experience.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
