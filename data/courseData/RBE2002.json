{"title": "UNIFIED ROBOTICS II", "level": "2002", "abbreviation": "RBE", "description": "Cat. I\n \nSecond of a four-course sequence introducing foundational theory and practice \nof robotics engineering from the fields of computer science, electrical engineering \nand mechanical engineering. The focus of this course is interaction with the \nenvironment through sensors, feedback and decision processes. Concepts of \nstress and strain as related to sensing of force, and principles of operation and\n interface methods for electronic transducers of strain, light, proximity and angle \nwill be presented. Basic feedback mechanisms for mechanical systems will be \nimplemented via electronic circuits and software mechanisms. The necessary\n software concepts will be introduced for modular design and implementation of \ndecision algorithms and finite state machines. Laboratory sessions consist of \nhands-on exercises and team projects where students design and build robots \nand related sub-systems.\n \nRecommended background: RBE 2001, CS 1101 or CS 1102", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
