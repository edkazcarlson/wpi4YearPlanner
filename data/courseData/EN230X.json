{"title": "STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE LIT", "level": "230X", "abbreviation": "EN", "description": "This course will examine literary works in two or more languages, modes, and/or traditions, connecting these works to other works of expressive culture in the visual and performing arts. Material from languages other than English will be read in English translation, but due attention will also be given to work in original languages. Engagement with drama, poetry, and prose from various periods and places will encourage students to connect themes across cultural, formal, and historical divides, utilizing interdisciplinary and theoretical methods in the process of their reading and writing. Prior knowledge of languages other than English is welcomed but not required for this course.\n  Suggested background: None, though coursework in English (e.g. EN 1251, Introduction to Literature) or any subsequent EN offering will be helpful, as will courses emphasizing literature and culture offered in AR, CN, GR, and/or SP.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
