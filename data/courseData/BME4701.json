"{\"title\": \"CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING\", \"level\": \"4701\", \"abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course examines the principles of molecular\\n and cell biology applied to the design of\\n engineered molecules, cells and tissues. Topics will\\n include the basic structural, chemical and physical\\n properties of biomolecules (proteins, lipids, DNA\\nand RNA), application of biomolecules to monitor \\nand alter cellular processes in vitro and in vivo,\\n and design considerations for engineering cell and molecular therapeutics. Case studies will be used \\nto examine specific applications of molecular and \\ncellular bioengineering technologies to treat disease\\n and promote tissue repair and regeneration.\\n \\nRecommended background: Cell biology (BB\\n 2550). Additional coursework in molecular biology \\n(BB 2950) and/or genetics (BB 2920) would\\n be beneficial.\\n Students who earned credit for BME 37XX cannot\\n receive credit for BME 4701.\", \"req\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2950\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2920\"]], [[\"BME\", \"XX\"], []], [[\"BME\"], [\"4701\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
