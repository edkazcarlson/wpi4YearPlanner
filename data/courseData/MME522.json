"{\"title\": \"APPLICATIONS OF CALCULUS\", \"level\": \"522\", \"abbreviation\": \"MME\", \"description\": \"There are three major goals for this course: to \\nestablish the underlying principles of calculus, \\nto reinforce students\\u2019 calculus skills through \\ninvestigation of applications involving those skills,\\n and to give students the opportunity to develop \\nprojects and laboratory assignments for use by\\n first-year calculus students. The course will focus \\nheavily on the use of technology to solve problems \\ninvolving applications of calculus concepts. In addition,\\n MME students will be expected to master \\nthe mathematical rigor of these calculus concepts \\nso that they will be better prepared to develop\\n their own projects and laboratory assignments. For \\nexample, if an MME student chose to develop a\\n lab on convergence of sequence, he/she would be \\nexpected to understand the rigorous definition of\\nconvergence and how to apply it to gain sufficient\\n and/or necessary conditions for convergence. The\\nprocess of developing these first-year calculus\\n assignments will enable the MME students to \\nincrease their own mathematical understanding of\\n concepts while learning to handle mathematical\\n and computer issues which will be encountered by \\ntheir own calculus students. Their understanding\\n of the concepts and applications of calculus will be \\nfurther reinforced through computer laboratory\\n assignments and group projects. Applications\\n might include exponential decay of drugs in the \\nbody, optimal crank shaft design, population\\n growth, or development of cruise control systems.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
