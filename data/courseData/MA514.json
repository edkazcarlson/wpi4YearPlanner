"{\"title\": \"NUMERICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA\", \"level\": \"514\", \"abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"description\": \"This course provides students with the skills \\nnecessary to develop, analyze and implement\\ncomputational methods in linear algebra. The \\ncentral topics include vector and matrix algebra, \\nvector and matrix norms, the singular value \\ndecomposition, the LU and QR decompositions,\\n Householder transformations and Givens\\n rotations, and iterative methods for solving linear\\n systems including Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR\\n and conjugate gradient methods; and eigenvalue\\n problems. Applications to such problem areas as \\nleast squares and optimization will be discussed.\\n Other topics might include: special linear systems,\\n such as symmetric, positive definite, banded or \\nsparse systems; preconditioning; the Cholesky decomposition;\\n sparse tableau and other least-square\\n methods; or algorithms for parallel architectures.\\n (Prerequisite: basic knowledge of linear algebra or \\nequivalent background. Knowledge of a higher level \\nprogramming language is assumed.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
