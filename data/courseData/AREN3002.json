"{\"title\": \"ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN III\", \"level\": \"3002\", \"abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"description\": \"This course aims to further a student\\u2019s knowledge of the architectural design process through study of ideas, principles and methods of design and construction. Studio: Architectural concepts are developed with the completion of a project of expanded scope and complexity. The course emphasizes the development of form, space, spatial relationships, materials, context, program, and architectural presentation techniques. Hand drawing and sketching, modeling and visualization software, orthographic drawings, detail drawings, and physical models are used to explore, develop, and communicate architectural design concepts. Lectures: The lecture/lab component of the course focuses on three-dimensional modeling and architectural representation techniques. Students are introduced to advanced modeling software in engineering and architectural design practice. Topics include three dimensional modeling, rendering, animation, and parametric design. \\nThis course uses studio, lecture, and lab based teaching methods \\nRecommended background: Intermediate architectural design (AREN 2002 and AREN 2004 or equivalent)\", \"req\": [[[\"AREN\"], [\"2002\"]], [[\"AREN\"], [\"2004\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
