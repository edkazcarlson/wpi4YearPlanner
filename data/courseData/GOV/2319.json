"{\"Course Name\": \"GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS\", \"Course Level\": \"2319\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"GOV\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nIt is apparent that environmental problems have outgrown national policy\\nframeworks. Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and \\ntransnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance \\ninvolves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves\\n uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways \\nin which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing \\ninternational institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting.\\n We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations \\nto communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special\\n interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students\\n will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global\\n environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species;\\n and climate change. The goals of this course are to gain an understanding of the\\n main positions in global environmental debates; critically analyze these\\n positions; and gain insight into the politics of global environmental policy and \\ngovernance.\\n \\n     Recommended Background: GOV 1303 or GOV 1320\\n.\\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2015\"}"
