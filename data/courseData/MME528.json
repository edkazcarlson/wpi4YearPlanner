"{\"title\": \"MATHEMATICAL MODELING AND PROBLEM SOLVING\", \"level\": \"528\", \"abbreviation\": \"MME\", \"description\": \"This course introduces students to the process of\\n developing mathematical models as a means for\\nsolving real problems. The course will encompass \\nseveral different modeling situations that utilize a\\nvariety of mathematical topics. The mathematical\\n fundamentals of these topics will be discussed, but\\nwith continued reference to their use in finding \\nthe solutions to problems. Problems to be covered\\ninclude balance in small group behavior, traffic \\nflow, air pollution flow, group decision making,\\ntransportation, assignment, project planning \\nand the critical path method, genetics, inventory \\ncontrol and queueing.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
