I\\n \\nThis course provides an introduction to engineering aspects of environmental\\nquality control. Students will learn fundamental science and engineering\\n principles needed for environmental engineering, including concepts in\\n chemistry, biology, physics, mass conservation, kinetics and reactor design. \\nThese principles are then applied to environmental engineering problems,\\n including modeling of pollutants in natural systems and design of unit processes \\nin engineered systems. Topics covered include environmental regulations, surface\\n and ground water quality, drinking water treatment, wastewater treatment, air\\n pollution, and hazardous waste management.\\n \\nRecommended background: college-level chemistry.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
