"{\"title\": \"NUMERICAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\", \"level\": \"512\", \"abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"description\": \"This course begins where MA 510 ends in the\\n study of the theory and practice of the numerical\\n solution of differential equations. Central topics \\ninclude a review of initial value problems, \\nincluding Euler\\u2019s method, Runge-Kutta methods,\\nmulti-step methods, implicit methods and predictor-\\ncorrector methods; the solution of two-point \\nboundary value problems by shooting methods \\nand by the discretization of the original problem\\n to form systems of nonlinear equations; numerical\\n stability; existence and uniqueness of solutions; \\nand an introduction to the solution of partial\\n differential equations by finite differences. Other\\n topics might include finite element or boundary \\nelement methods, Galerkin methods, collocation,\\n or variational methods. (Prerequisites: graduate or \\nundergraduate numerical analysis. Knowledge of a \\nhigher-level programming language is assumed.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
