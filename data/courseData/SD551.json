{"title": "MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX PROBLEMS", "level": "551", "abbreviation": "SD", "description": "This course deals with the hands on detail related \nto analysis of complex problems and design of \npolicy for change through building models and \nexperimenting with them. Topics covered include: \nslicing complex problems and constructing reference \nmodes; going from a dynamic hypothesis \nto a formal model and organization of complex \nmodels; specification of parameters and graphical\n functions; experimentations for model understanding, \nconfidence building, policy design and\n policy implementation. Modeling examples will \ndraw largely from public policy agendas. (Pre-requisites: \nSD 550 System Dynamics Foundation:\n Managing Complexity.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
