"{\"title\": \"DYNAMICS AND SIGNAL ANALYSIS\", \"level\": \"621\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"A laboratory-based course which applies Fourier\\n and cepstral signal analysis techniques to mechanical\\nengineering problems. The theory and\\n application of the Fourier series, Fast Fourier \\nTransform (FFT) and the cepstrum to the analysis of mechanical and acoustical systems is presented. \\nDigital sampling theory, windowing, aliasing,\\n filtering, noise averaging and deconvolution are\\n discussed. Limitations of and errors in implementation \\nof these techniques are demonstrated. \\nStudents will perform weekly experiments in the \\nStructural Dynamics and Vibration Laboratory,\\n which reinforce the theories presented in lectures. \\nApplication will include structures, acoustics, \\nrotating machinery and cams.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
