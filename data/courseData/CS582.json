{"title": "BIOVISUALIZATION", "level": "582", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "This course will use interactive visualization to model and analyze biological information,\nstructures, and processes. Topics will include the \nfundamental principles, concepts, and techniques \nof visualization (both scientific and information \nvisualization) and how visualization can be used \nto study bioinformatics data at the genomic,\n cellular, molecular, organism, and population \nlevels. Students will be expected to write small to \nmoderate programs to experiment with different\n visual mappings and data types. (Prerequisite:\nstrong programming skills, an undergraduate or \ngraduate course in algorithms, and one or more undergraduate biology courses.) Students may not \nreceive credit for both CS 582 and CS 4802.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
