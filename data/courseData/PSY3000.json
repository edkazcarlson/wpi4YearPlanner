{"title": "PSYCHOLOGY AND LAW", "level": "3000", "abbreviation": "PSY", "description": "How does the courtroom work and where does psychology come into play? Is it really \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d? Do people confess to crimes they never committed? How accurate are eyewitnesses? In this course, we will discuss and examine questions like these and many more. This course examines empirical research in the interface of psychology and law. We will learn about standard practices in the criminal justice system and empirical psychological research devoted to understanding these practices. As a discussion-based course, we will tackle topics such as: courtroom procedures, confessions, death penalty, deception, decision making, deliberations, eyewitnesses, expert testimony, jury selection, memory, police, and pretrial publicity. We will also explore how and when psychologists can impact legal guidelines and policies.\n     Recommended background: Introduction to Psychological Science (PSY 1400), Social Psychology (PSY 1402) and/or Cognitive Psychology (PSY 1401). Courses in Government and Policy Studies will also be beneficial.", "req": [[["PSY"], ["1400"]], [["PSY"], ["1402"]], [["PSY"], ["1401"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
