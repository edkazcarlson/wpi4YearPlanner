"{\"title\": \"MAKING MUSIC WITH MACHINES\", \"level\": \"2801\", \"abbreviation\": \"MU\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\nThis course will explore aesthetic and technical considerations of physical automatic mechanical (electro)acoustic instruments and the music that they make. \\nThe history of automatic mechanical instruments reaches back centuries: we will explore some of this history by looking at past designs and listening to the sounds such designs produce. We will consider some of the music that has been composed using such instruments, including Nancarrow's Player Piano Studies, Ligeti's Barrel Organ music, and Gann's pieces for Disklavier. We will also look at modern efforts, which have increasingly moved towards robotics with the integration of computer-\\nbased processing and sensing capabilities. We will ask how the music that these \\nmachines make is a product of their design. The technical and project-based \\ncomponents of this course will introduce students to principles involved in instrument design, actuators, electronic circuits, microcontrollers, and musical programming environments.  We will do all of this with the goal of designing and building new machines to make new kinds of music.\\n     Students who already received credit for MU201x cannot receive credit for MU 2801.\\n     Recommended Background: Fundamentals of Music I and / or Fundamentals of Music II.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
