"{\"title\": \"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ADAPTIVE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY\", \"level\": \"568\", \"abbreviation\": \"CS\", \"description\": \"Students will learn how to enable educational\\n technology to adapt to the user and about typical\\n architectures used by existing intelligent tutoring\\n systems for adapting to users. Students will\\n see applications of decision theoretic systems, \\nreinforcement learning, Markov models for action\\n selection, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning.\\n Students will read papers that apply AI techniques \\nfor the purpose of adapting to users. Students will\\ncomplete a project that applies these techniques to \\nbuild an adaptive educational system.
