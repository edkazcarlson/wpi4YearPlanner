"{\"title\": \"BIG DATA ANALYTICS\", \"level\": \"504\", \"abbreviation\": \"DS\", \"description\": \"Innovation and discoveries are no longer hindered by the ability to collect data, but the ability to summarize, analyze, and discover knowledge from the collected data in a scalable fashion. This course covers computational techniques and algorithms for analyzing and mining patterns in large-scale datasets. Techniques studied address data analysis issues related to data volume (scalable and distributed analysis), data velocity (high-speed data streams), data variety\\n(complex, heterogeneous, or unstructured data), and data veracity (data uncertainty). Techniques include mining and machine learning techniques for complex data types, and scaleup and scale-out strategies that leverage big data infrastructures. Real-world applications using these techniques, for instance social media analysis and scientific data mining, are selectively discussed. Students are expected to engage in hands-on projects using one or more of these technologies. Prerequisites: A beginning course in databases and a beginning course in data\\nmining, or equivalent knowledge, and programming experience.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
