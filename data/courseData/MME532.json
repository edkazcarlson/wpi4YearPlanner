{"title": "DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS", "level": "532", "abbreviation": "MME", "description": "This course would have concepts and techniques for both Ordinary and Partial\nDifferential Equations. Topics from ordinary differential equations include\nexistence and uniqueness for first order, single variable problems as well as\nseparation of variables and linear methods for first order problems. Second order,\nlinear equations would be solved for both the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous\ncases. The phenomena of beats and resonance would be analyzed. The Laplace Transform would be introduced for appropriate second order nonhomogeneous problems. Partial Differential Equations would focus on boundary value problems arising from the Heat and Wave equations in one variable. Fourier Series expansions would be used to satisfy initial conditions and the concepts of orthogonality and convergence addressed.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
