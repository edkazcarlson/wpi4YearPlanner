"{\"title\": \"MANUFACTURING SCIENCE, PROTOTYPING, AND COMPUTER-CONTROLLED MACHINING\", \"level\": \"1800\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"Cat. I \\n\\nThis course introduces students to manufacturing science and engineering and \\nprototype part production. It emphasizes CNC (computer-controlled)\\n machining. Students will learn how to go from a solid (CAD, computer-aided \\ndesign) model to a machined part, using CAM software (computer-aided \\nmanufacturing) and CNC machining. They will also be exposed to associated \\nissues in manufacturing process analysis, engineering design, material science,\\n and in dimensional and surface metrology. Using machining as an example, the \\nscience of manufacturing processes is developed in a combination of class work \\nand laboratory experience. The laboratory experience includes an experimental\\ncomponent that relates process variables in machining with performance and \\nmachined part quality. Students whose project work will necessitate fabrication \\nof parts and those who want a background in manufacturing process science and\\n engineering should take this course.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
