{"title": "DISTRIBUTED AND RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION", "level": "5532", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "This course introduces the characteristics and challenges of interconnecting increasing numbers of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the Electric Power System (EPS).  Topics include: challenges to distribution and transmission system protection; local voltage control; ride through; optimal interconnection transformer configurations; and practical engineering approaches to maintain system reliability and protection. The current and evolving interconnection standard (IEEE 1547) is included. (Prerequisites:  ECE 5500 Power System Analysis plus either ECE 5520 Power System Protection and Control or ECE 5521 Protective Relaying.  ECE 5530 Power Distribution highly recommended.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
