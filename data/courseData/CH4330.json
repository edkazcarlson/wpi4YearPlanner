Discussions may emphasize the logic and strategy in synthetic approaches toward active pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemicals, fine chemicals, materials, and other targets of interest. The analysis of current examples from the primary literature will draw attention to the most state-of\\u2013the-art synthetic tactics. \\n  Recommended for graduate students and undergraduates who have a basic understanding of the principles governing organic reactions, such as those covered in CH2310, CH2320, and CH2330.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": -1}"
