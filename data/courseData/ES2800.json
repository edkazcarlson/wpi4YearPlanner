"{\"title\": \"ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENGINEERING DECISIONS\", \"level\": \"2800\", \"abbreviation\": \"ES\", \"description\": \"Cat. II\\nEngineering decisions can affect the environment on local and global scales. This\\ncourse will introduce students to concepts that will make them aware of the\\n ramifications of their engineering decisions, and is intended for engineering\\n students of all disciplines. Specific topics the course will cover include: \\nenvironmental issues, waste minimization, energy conservation, water\\n conservation and reuse, regulations (OSHA, TSCA, RCRA, etc.), life cycle \\nassessment, risk assessment, sustainability, design for the environment, and \\nenvironmental impact statements. Energy and mass balances will be applied to\\n activities that impact the environment. Instruction will be provided through\\nlectures, practitioner seminars, and a term project. Intended audience: all\\n engineering majors desiring a general knowledge of the environmental impacts \\nof engineering decisions.\\n \\n     Recommended background: elementary college chemistry; second year\\nstudents.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": \"2016\"}"
