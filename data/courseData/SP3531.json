II\\nThis course introduces students to the field of Latino studies, paying particular\\nattention to the cultural productions of U.S. Latinos in film, theater, music, \\nfiction writing and cultural criticism. At the same time that this course reflects \\nupon a transnational framework for understanding the continuum between U.S. \\nLatinos and Latin American/Caribbean communities, we closely examine more\\n U.S. based arguments supporting and contesting the use of Latino as an ethnic racial\\n term uniting all U.S. Latino communities. We examine the ways in which \\nU.S. Latinos have manufactured identities within dominant as well as counter \\ncultural registers. In this course, special attention is given to the aesthetics of autobiography and to how Latino writers experiment with this genre in order to \\naddress changing constructions of immigration, language, exile, and identity.\\n This course is taught in English.\\n \\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\\n     This course satisfies the Inquiry Practicum requirement.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": \"2016\"}"
