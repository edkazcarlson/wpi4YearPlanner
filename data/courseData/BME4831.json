I\nThe course examines fundamental composition, structure, property and performance relationships in classical and novel drug delivery systems as part of disease treatment strategies (i.e. cancer, organ damage). Physiological barriers to drug delivery and methods to overcome these barriers are analyze. The course will familiarize students with biomaterial-based drug delivery systems that have recently been developed. Topics include routes of drug administration, diffusion, Fick's law, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, drug modifications, materials for drug delivery (implantable, transdermal, injectable), antibody therapeutics, cells as drugs and drug delivery vehicles, and novel drug formulations and delivery systems.\n  Recommended background: Fundamental knowledge of biomaterials (e.g. BME 2811 or equivalent), multivariable calculus (e.g. MA 1024 or equivalent) and biological system function or cell function (e.g., BB 1035 or BB 2550 or equivalent).", "req": [[["BME"], ["2811"]], [["MA"], ["1024"]], [["BB"], ["1035"]], [["BB"], ["2550"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
