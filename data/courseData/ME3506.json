I\nThis project based design course focuses on the design and use of devices to aid persons with disabilities.  Human factors and ergonomics are integrated into all phases of the design process with particular emphasis on the user interface.\nTopics include: defining the problem, developing design specifications, development of preliminary designs, selecting, realization and evaluation of a final design.  Students will also learn how physical and cognitive parameters, safety, economics, reliability and aesthetics need to be incorporated into the design process.\n     Recommended background: mechanics (ES 2501, ES 2502, ES 2503), design (ME 2300), materials (ME 1800) and electrical engineering (ECE 2010).", "req": [[["ES"], ["2501"]], [["ES"], ["2502"]], [["ES"], ["2503"]], [["ME"], ["2300"]], [["ME"], ["1800"]], [["ECE"], ["2010"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
