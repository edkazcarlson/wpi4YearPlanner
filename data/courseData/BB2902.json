I (1/6 unit)\nThis course gives basic practical experimental experience in enzymology, how enzymes work and how to purify them for later use.  These techniques are the foundation the design and production of many therapeutic products. Examples of the types of techniques and experiences included in this course are:\n\u2022\tThe action and optima of enzyme catalysis\n\u2022\tInduction of enzyme production\n\u2022\tQuantification and detection techniques for proteins\n\u2022\tExtraction and purification of protein from biological material using column chromatography\n\u2022\tIdentification of compounds using Thin Layer Chromatography\n\nRecommended background: BB 1035 (Biotechnology)or equivalent", "req": [[["BB"], ["1035"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
