"{\"title\": \"APPLIED FINITE ELEMENT METHODS IN ENGINEERING\", \"level\": \"5303\", \"abbreviation\": \"CE\", \"description\": \"This course is devoted to the numerical solution\\n of partial differential equations encountered in\\nengineering sciences. Finite element methods are \\nintroduced and developed in a logical progression \\nof complexity. Topics covered include matrix\\n structural analysis variation form of differential \\nequations, Ritz and weighted residual approximations,\\n and development of the discretized domain\\n solution. Techniques are developed in detail for \\nthe one- and two-dimensional equilibrium and \\ntransient problems. These numerical strategies\\n are used to solve actual problems in heat flow,\\n diffusion, wave propagation, vibrations, fluid mechanics, \\nhydrology and solid mechanics. Weekly\\ncomputer exercises are required to illustrate the\\n concepts discussed in class. Students cannot receive\\n credit for this course if they have taken the Special\\n Topics (ME 593E) version of the same course or ME\\n 533 or CE 524.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
