"{\"title\": \"ADVANCED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING\", \"level\": \"630\", \"abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"description\": \"The course will cover a set of important topics \\nin signal and image analysis: orthogonal signal\\n decomposition, wavelet transforms, analytic signals,\\n time-frequency estimation, 2D FT, Hankel \\ntransform and tomographic reconstruction. In \\naddition, the course will each year have selected \\ncurrent topics in signal processing, e.g., ambiguity \\nfunctions in RADAR and SONAR, coded waveforms,\\n Fourier based beamforming for 2D arrays\\n and single value decomposition. In place of a final \\nexam, there will be a student project. The course \\nis intended for students working in areas such as \\nimage analysis, NDE, ultrasound, audio, speech,\\n RADAR, SONAR and date compression. Signal/\\nimage theory and applications will be emphasized\\n over coding; however, Matlab-based modules for\\n self-paced signal/image visualization and manipulation \\nwill be part of the course. (Prerequisites: \\nECE 504 Analysis of Deterministic Signals and \\nSystems, undergraduate course in linear systems\\n theory and vector calculus.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
