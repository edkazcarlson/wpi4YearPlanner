{"title": "FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS", "level": "504", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "This course will give a comprehensive presentation of fundamental concepts and theorems in Banach and Hilbert spaces. Whenever possible, the theory will be illustrated by examples in Lebesgue spaces. Topics include: The Hahn-Banach theorems, the Uniform Boundedness principle (Banach-Steinhaus Theorem), the Open Mapping and Closed Graph theorems, and weak topologies and convergence. Additional topics will be covered at the instructor\u2019s discretion. (Prerequisite: MA 503 or equivalent.)\u00a0\r\n", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
