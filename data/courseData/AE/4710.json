"{\"Course Name\": \"GAS TURBNS FR PRPLSN & PWR GEN\", \"Course Level\": \"4710\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I \\nThis course provides a study of open-cycle and closed-cycle gas turbines. Topics covered include: thermodynamic cycles and fluid dynamics of airbreathing gas turbines (turbojets, turbofans, turboprops), ramjets, and scramjets; thermodynamic cycles and fluid dynamics of closed-cycle gas turbines. Performance of specific engine components such as inlets, combustors, nozzles, as well as axial compressors and turbines will be addressed. \\n\\nRecommended background: compressible fluid dynamics (AE/ME 3410 or equivalent).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ME\"], [\"3410\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
