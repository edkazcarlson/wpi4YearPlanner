"{\"Course Name\": \"INTRODUCTION TO CONTROL OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"3703\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I \\nThe course introduces the mathematical modeling and control of dynamical systems found in aerospace and mechanical engineering applications. Topics include: introduction to feedback control analysis and synthesis of linear dynamic systems; transient response analysis of first and second order systems (thermal, pneumatic, hydraulic, and mechanical); introduction to state-space modeling and representation of control systems; linearization of nonlinear systems; stability analysis using Routh\\u2019s criterion and Lyapunov methods; system analysis using frequency response methods; introduction to the design of controlers in time and frequency domain. The analysis and design will be\\naccomplished with Matlab/Simulink\\u00ae software. \\n\\nRecommended background: ordinary differential equations (MA 2051 or equivalent), dynamics (ES 2503, PH 2201, PH 2202 or equivalent), fluid dynamics (ES3004, AE/ME 3602 or equivalent), electricity and magnetism (PH 1120 or PH 1121 or equivalent)\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2503\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"2201\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"2202\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3004\"]], [[\"ME\"], [\"3602\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1120\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1121\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
