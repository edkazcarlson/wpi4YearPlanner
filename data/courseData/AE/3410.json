"{\"Course Name\": \"COMPRESSIBLE FLUID DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"3410\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I \\nIn this course, students are introduced to various compressibility phenomena such as compression (shock) and expansion waves. Conservation laws and thermodynamic principles are applied to the description of flows in which compressibility effects are significant. One-dimensional models are applied to analysis of flow in variable area ducts, normal and oblique shock waves,\\nexpansion waves, and flows with friction and heat addition. Numerous applications from engineering are investigated including supersonic inlets, rocket nozzles, supersonic wind tunnels, gas delivery systems, and afterburning jet engines.\\n\\nRecommended background: thermodynamics (ES 3001, CH 3510 or equivalent), fluid dynamics (ES 3004 or equivalent).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"3001\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"3510\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3004\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
