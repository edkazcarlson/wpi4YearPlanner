"{\"Course Name\": \"TURBOMACHINERY\", \"Course Level\": \"5104\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"Course Description\": \"(2 Credits)\\nThis course is an introduction to the fluid mechanics and thermodynamics of turbomachinery for propulsion and power generation applications. Axial and centrifugal compressors will be discussed as well as axial and radial flow turbines. Analysis of the mean line flow in compressor and turbine blade rows and stages will be discussed. The blade-to-blade flow model will be presented and axisymmetric flow theory introduced. Three-dimensional flow, i.e. secondary flows, will also be discussed. Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics (ME 593H) version of the same course.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
