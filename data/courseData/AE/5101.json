"{\"Course Name\": \"FLUID DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"5101\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course presents the following fundamental topics in fluid dynamics: concept of continuum in fluids; kinematics and deformation for Newtonian fluids; \\n the mass conservation equation for material volumes and \\ncontrol volumes; the differential form of mass conservation, momentum and energy equations. This course covers applied topics chosen from:\\n unidirectional steady incompressible viscous flows; unidirectional transient incompressible viscous flows; lubrication flows similarity and dimensional analysis. This is an introductory graduate-level course and may be taken independent of AE 5107/ME 5107.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
