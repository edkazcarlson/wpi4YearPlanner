"{\"Course Name\": \"MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"565\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SD\", \"Course Description\": \"There are three parts to this course. The first \\nacquaints a student with dynamic macroeconomic\\n data and the stylized facts seen in most macroeconomic\\n systems. Characteristics of the data\\n related to economic growth, economic cycles,\\n and the interactions between economic growth \\nand economic cycles that are seen as particularly \\nimportant when viewed through the lens of\\n system dynamics will be emphasized. The second \\nacquaints a student with the basics of macroeconomic\\n growth and business cycle theory. This is\\n accomplished by presenting well-known models \\nof economic growth and instability, from both the\\n orthodox and heterodox perspectives, via system\\n dynamics. The third part attempts to enhance a\\n student\\u2019s ability to build and critique dynamic \\nmacroeconomic models by addressing such topics \\nas the translation of difference and differential\\n equation models into their equivalent system\\n dynamics representation, fitting system dynamics\\n models to macroeconomic data, and evaluating \\n(formally and informally) a model\\u2019s validity for the \\npurpose of theory selection. (Pre-requisites: \\nSD 550 System Dynamics Foundation: Managing \\nComplexity.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
