"{\"Course Name\": \"MODEL ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION TECHNIQUES\", \"Course Level\": \"553\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SD\", \"Course Description\": \"This course focuses on analysis of models rather \\nthan conceptualization and model development. \\nIt provides techniques for exercising models, \\nimproving their quality and gaining added \\ninsights into what models have to say about a \\nproblem. Five major topics are covered: use of\\n subscripts, achieving and testing for robustness, \\nuse of numerical data, sensitivity analysis, and \\noptimization/calibration of models. The subscripts\\n discussion provides techniques for dealing with\\n detail complexity by changing model equations \\nbut not adding additional feedback structure. Robust\\n models are achieved by using good individual\\n equation formulations and making sure that they \\nwork together well through automated behavioral\\n experiments. Data, especially time series data, are \\nfundamental to finding and fixing shortcomings \\nin model formulations. Sensitivity simulations \\nexpose the full range of behavior that a model can \\nexhibit. Finally, the biggest section, dealing with \\noptimization and calibration of models develops \\ntechniques for both testing models against data\\n and developing policies to achieve specified goals.\\n Though a number of statistical issues are touched \\nupon during the course, only a basic knowledge \\nof statistics and statistical hypothesis testing is \\nrequired. (Prerequisites: SD 550 System Dynamics\\n Foundation: Managing Complexity and SD 551\\n Modeling and Experimental Analysis of Complex\\n Problems, or permission of the instructor.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
