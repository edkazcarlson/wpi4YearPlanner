"{\"Course Name\": \"INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODELING\", \"Course Level\": \"1510\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SD\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I \\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with an introduction to the field of\\nsystem dynamics computer simulation modeling. The course begins with the\\n history of system dynamics and the study of why policy makers can benefit from \\nits use. Next, students systematically examine the various types of dynamic \\nbehavior that socioeconomic systems exhibit and learn to identify and model the \\nunderlying nonlinear stock-flow-feedback loop structures that cause them. The \\ncourse concludes with an examination of a set of well-known system dynamics \\nmodels that have been created to address a variety of socioeconomic problems. \\nEmphasis is placed on how the system dynamics modeling process is used to test\\n proposed policy changes and how the implementation of model-based results\\n can improve the behavior of socioeconomic systems.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
