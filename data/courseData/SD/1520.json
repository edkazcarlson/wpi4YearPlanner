"{\"Course Name\": \"SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODELING\", \"Course Level\": \"1520\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SD\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThe purpose of this course is to prepare students to produce original system\\ndynamics computer simulation models of economic and social systems. Models\\n of this type can be used to examine the possible impacts of policy changes and \\ntechnological innovations on socioeconomic systems. The curriculum in this \\ncourse is divided into three distinct parts. First, a detailed examination of the \\nsteps of the system dynamics modeling process: problem identification \\n(including data collection), feedback structure conceptualization, model\\n formulation, model testing and analysis, model documentation and presentation,\\n and policy implementation. Second, a survey of the \\\"nuts and bolts\\\" of\\ncontinuous simulation modeling: information and material delays, time\\nconstants, the use of noise and numerical integration techniques, control theory \\nheuristics, and software details (both simulation and model presentation and \\ndocumentation software). Third, a step-by-step, in-class production of a model, \\ninvolving the construction, testing, and assembly of subsectors. Students will be \\nrequired to complete modeling assignments working in groups and take in-class \\nquizzes on modeling issues. \\nRecommended background: SD 1510, or permission of instructor.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"SD\"], [\"1510\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
