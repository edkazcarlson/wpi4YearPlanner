"{\"Course Name\": \"MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX PROBLEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"551\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SD\", \"Course Description\": \"This course deals with the hands on detail related \\nto analysis of complex problems and design of \\npolicy for change through building models and \\nexperimenting with them. Topics covered include: \\nslicing complex problems and constructing reference \\nmodes; going from a dynamic hypothesis \\nto a formal model and organization of complex \\nmodels; specification of parameters and graphical\\n functions; experimentations for model understanding, \\nconfidence building, policy design and\\n policy implementation. Modeling examples will \\ndraw largely from public policy agendas. (Pre-requisites: \\nSD 550 System Dynamics Foundation:\\n Managing Complexity.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
