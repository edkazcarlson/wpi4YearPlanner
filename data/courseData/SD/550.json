What causes oscillation and \\namplification \\u2013 the so called \\u201cbull whip\\u201d \\u2013 in\\n supply chains? Why do large scale projects so \\ncommonly over overrun their budgets and schedules?\\n This course explores the counter-intuitive\\n dynamics of complex organizations and how \\nmanagers can make the difference between success\\n and failure. Students learn how even small changes \\nin organizational structure can produce dramatic \\nchanges in organizational behavior. Real cases and\\n computer simulation modeling combine for an \\nin-depth examination of the feedback concept in\\n complex systems. Topics include: supply chain \\ndynamics, project dynamics, commodity cycles, new product diffusion, and business growth and \\ndecline. The emphasis throughout is on the unifying\\n concepts of system dynamics.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
