"{\"Course Name\": \"STRATEGIC MODELING AND BUSINESS DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"556\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SD\", \"Course Description\": \"The performance of firms and industries over \\ntime rarely unfolds in the way management \\nteams expect or intend. The purpose of strategic \\nmodeling and business dynamics is to investigate\\n dynamic complexity by better understanding how\\n the parts of an enterprise operate, fit together and \\ninteract. By modeling and simulating the relationships \\namong the parts we can anticipate potential\\n problems, avoid strategic pitfalls and take steps to \\nimprove performance. We study a variety of business \\napplications covering topics such as cyclicality \\nin manufacturing, market growth and capital \\ninvestment. The models are deliberately small and \\nconcise so their structure and formulations can be \\npresented in full and used to illustrate principles \\nof model conceptualization, equation formulation\\n and simulation analysis. We also review\\n some larger models that arose from real-world\\n applications including airlines, the oil industry,\\n the chemicals industry and fast moving consumer\\n goods. Students work with selected business policy\\n problems based on generic structures discussed in \\nthe lessons. Pre-requisite: SD 550 System Dynamics \\nFoundation: Managing Complexity.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
