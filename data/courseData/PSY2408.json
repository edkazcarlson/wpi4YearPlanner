Finally, stress infiltrates chronic health outcomes such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. We will also review what \u2018positive health\u2019 means including nutrition, exercise, social support, managing stress, and habits for maintaining good health. Students will engage in research-based learning when considering psychological, cultural, and biological interventions for real world health crises. \n     Recommended background: Introduction to Psychological Science (PSY 1400) and/or Social Psychology (PSY 1402).", "req": [[["PSY"], ["1400"]], [["PSY"], ["1402"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
