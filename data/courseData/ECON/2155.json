"{\"Course Name\": \"EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"2155\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECON\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nExperimental economics is a set of methods for testing hypotheses about\\nbehavior. Traditional economic analysis using naturally occurring data is often \\nconfounded by the complexities of the real world. Economic experiments, on\\n the other hand, give researchers the control required for isolating behaviors of\\n interest. As such, economic experiments can be useful tools for testing existing \\ntheories and establishing empirical regularities assisting in the development of \\nnew theories. In this course, we cover the basic principles of experimental\\n design. We also study a number of classic experiments, on topics ranging from \\nthe efficiency of markets to decision-making under uncertainty and behavioral\\n game theory. Students will participate in mock experiments and will begin \\nputting their new skills into practice by designing their own experiments, which \\nmay serve as the basis for IQPs/MQPs. If time permits, we will discuss some of \\nthe basic methods for analyzing experimental data, which presents challenges \\nsomewhat different from naturally occurring data due to small sample sizes.\\n \\n     Recommended Background: ECON 1110\\n.\\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2015\"}"
