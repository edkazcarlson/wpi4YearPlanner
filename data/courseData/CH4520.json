II\\nThis course deals with how the electronic, translational, \\nrotational and vibrational energy levels of \\nindividual molecules, or of macromolecular systems \\nare statistically related to the energy, entropy\\n and free energy of macroscopic systems, taking\\n into account the quantum mechanical properties \\nof the component particles. Ensembles, partition\\nfunctions, and Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-\\nEinstein statistics are used. A wealth of physical\\n chemical phenomena, including material related\\n to solids, liquids, gases, spectroscopy and chemical\\n reactions are made understandable by the concepts \\nlearned in this course.\\nRecommended background: CH 3510 and CH 2530, or equivalent, and mathematics through differential equations and integral calculus.\\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"3510\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2530\"]]], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": \"2015\"}"
