"{\"Course Name\": \"CALCULUS II (SEMESTER VERSION)\", \"Course Level\": \"1120\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat.I \\nThe topics for integral calculus (MA 1022) are covered in this course: the \\nconcept of the definite integral, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, \\nintegration techniques, and applications of integration. Applications include: area, volume, arc length, center of mass, work, force, and exponential growth\\n and decay. Logarithmic and exponential functions are studied in depth. \\nArithmetic and geometric sequences and series will also be covered. Key historical events in the development of integral calculus are examined.\\nTechnology will be used as appropriate to support the material being studied. \\n\\nThis course extends for 14 weeks and offers 1/3 unit of credit. It is designed \\nfor students who would benefit from additional contact hours and who need to\\n strengthen their mathematical background. Although the course will make use\\n of computers, no programming experience is assumed.\\n \\nStudents may not receive credit for both MA 1120 and MA 1022 or MA 1102.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
