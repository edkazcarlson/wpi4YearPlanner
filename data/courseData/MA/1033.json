"{\"Course Name\": \"THEORETICAL CALCULUS III\", \"Course Level\": \"1033\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"This course will cover the same material as MA 1023 Calculus III but from a different perspective. A more rigorous study of sequences and series will be undertaken: starting from the least upper bound property in R, the fundamental theorems for convergent series will be proved. Convergence criteria for series will be rigorously justified and L'Hospital's rule will be introduced and proved. Homework problems will include a blend of computational exercises as usually assigned in MA 1023 Calculus III and problems with a stronger theoretical flavor. \\nRecommended background: Differential and integral calculus (MA1021 and MA 1022, or equivalent). \\nNote: Students can receive credit for this class and MA1023 Calculus III.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"1021\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"1022\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"1023\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
