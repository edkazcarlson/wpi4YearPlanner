"{\"Course Name\": \"CONVEX ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION\", \"Course Level\": \"524\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"This course covers topics in functional analysis\\n that are critical to the study of convex optimization\\nproblems. The first part of the course will \\ninclude the minimization theory for quadratic and \\nconvex functionals on convex sets and cones, the \\nLegendre-Fenchel duality, variational inequalities\\n and complementarity systems. The second part \\nwill include optimal stopping time problems in \\ndeterministic control, value functions and Hamilton-\\nJacobi inequalities and linear and quadratic \\nprogramming, duality and Kuhn-Tucker multipliers.\\n Other related topics will be covered at the \\ninstructor\\u2019s discretion. (Prerequisite: MA 503.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
