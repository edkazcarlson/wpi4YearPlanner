"{\"Course Name\": \"PROBABILITY\", \"Course Level\": \"2631\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThe purpose of this course is twofold:\\n- To introduce the student to probability. Topics to be covered will be chosen \\nfrom: axiomatic development of probability; independence; Bayes theorem;\\n discrete and continuous random variables; expectation; special distributions\\n including the binomial and normal; moment generating functions; multivariate\\n distributions; conditional and marginal distributions; independence \\nof random variables; transformations of random variables; limit theorems.\\n- To introduce fundamental ideas and methods of mathematics using the \\nstudy of probability as the vehicle. These ideas and methods may include\\n systematic theorem-proof development starting with basic axioms; \\nmathematical induction; set theory; applications of univariate and \\nmultivariate calculus.\\n \\nThis course is designed primarily for Mathematical Sciences majors and those \\ninterested in the deeper mathematical issues underlying probability theory.\\n \\nRecommended background: MA 1024. \\nUndergraduate credit may not be earned both for this course and for MA 2621.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"1024\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2621\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
