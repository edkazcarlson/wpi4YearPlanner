"{\"Course Name\": \"MATHEMATICAL MODELING WITH ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\", \"Course Level\": \"2431\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course focuses on the principles of building mathematical models from a physical, chemical or biological system and interpreting the results. Students will learn how to construct a mathematical model and will be able to interpret solutions of this model in terms of the context of the application. Mathematical topics focus on solving systems of ordinary differential equations, and may include the use of stability theory and phase-plane analysis. Applications will be chosen from electrical and mechanical oscillations, control theory, ecological or epidemiological models and reaction kinetics. This course is designed primarily for students interested in the deeper mathematical issues underlying mathematical modeling. Students may be required to use programming languages such as Matlab or Maple to further investigate different models. Recommended background: multivariable calculus (MA 1024 or equivalent), ordinary differential equations (MA 2051 or equivalent), and linear algebra (MA 2071 or equivalent).\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"1024\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2071\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
