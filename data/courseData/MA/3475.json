"{\"Course Name\": \"CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS\", \"Course Level\": \"3475\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis course covers the calculus of variations and select topics from optimal control\\ntheory. The purpose of the course is to expose students to mathematical concepts \\nand techniques needed to handle various problems of design encountered in \\nmany fields, e. g. electrical engineering, structural mechanics and manufacturing.\\n \\nTopics covered will include: derivation of the necessary conditions of a \\nminimum for simple variational problems and problems with constraints,\\n variational principles of mechanics and physics, direct methods of minimization \\nof functions, Pontryagin's maximum principle in the theory of optimal control\\n and elements of dynamic programming.\\n \\n     Recommended background: MA 2051.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
