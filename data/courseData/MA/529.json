"{\"Course Name\": \"STOCHASTIC PROCESSES\", \"Course Level\": \"529\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"This course is designed to introduce students to continuous-time stochastic processes. Stochastic processes play a central role in a wide range of applications from signal processing to finance and also offer an alternative novel viewpoint to several areas of mathematical analysis, such as partial differential equations and potential theory.\\nThe main topics for this course are martingales, maximal inequalities and applications, optimal stopping and martingale convergence theorems, the strong Markov property, stochastic integration, Ito's formula and applications, martingale representation theorems, Girsanov's theorem and applications, and an introduction to stochastic differential equations, the Feynman-Kac formula, and connections to partial differential equations.\\nOptional topics (at the instructor's discretion) include Markov processes and Poisson-and jump-processes. (Prerequisite: MA 528. Measure- Theoretic Probability Theory, which can be taken concurrently (or, with special permission by the instructor, MA 540)).\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
