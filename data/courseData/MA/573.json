"{\"Course Name\": \"COMPUTATIONAL METHODS OF FINANCIAL MATHEMATICS\", \"Course Level\": \"573\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"Course Description\": \"Most realistic quantitative finance models are too\\n complex to allow explicit analytic solutions and \\nare solved by numerical computational methods.\\nThe first part of the course covers the application\\n of finite difference methods to the partial differential\\n equations and interest rate models arising \\nin finance. Topics included are explicit, implicit\\n and Crank-Nicholson finite difference schemes \\nfor fixed and free boundary value problems, their\\n convergence and stability. The second part of the\\n course covers Monte Carlo simulation methods, \\nincluding random number generation, variance reduction \\ntechniques and the use of low discrepancy\\n sequences. (Prerequisites: MA 571 and programming \\nskills at the level of MA 579, which can be \\ntaken concurrently.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
