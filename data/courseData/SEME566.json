{"title": "GRAPHICAL MODELS FOR REASONING UNDER UNCERTAINTY", "level": "566", "abbreviation": "SEME", "description": "This course will introduce students to graphical\n models, such as Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov\n Models, Kalman filters, particle filters, and\n structural equation models. Graphical models are\n applicable in a wide variety of work in computer \nscience for reasoning under uncertainty such as \nuser modeling, speech recognition, computer \nvision, object tracking, and determining a robot\u2019s\n location. This course will cover 1) using data to\nestimate the parameters and structure of a model \nusing techniques such as expectation maximization,\n 2) understanding techniques for performing \nefficient inference on new observations such as \njunction trees and sampling, and 3) learning about \nevaluation techniques to determine whether a\n particular model is a good one.
