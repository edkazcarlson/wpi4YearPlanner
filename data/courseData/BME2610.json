"{\"title\": \"INTRODUCTION TO BIOPROCESS ENGINEERING\", \"level\": \"2610\", \"abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\nThis course is an introduction to fundamental material and energy balances related to the field of Biomedical Engineering. The fundamentals of bioprocess engineering calculations and data analysis, and bioengineering processes and process variables will be covered. Students will learn to identify a system, define boundary conditions, and characterize the system processes to generate appropriate material and energy balances using the principles of conservation of mass and energy. Fundamentals and applications in the human body and biomanufacturing are examined. Specific examples may include an organ, multiple organs or the entire body, bioprocess instrumentation, individual or groups of cells, cell culture bioreactors, tissue engineered scaffolds, and drug delivery systems.\\n  Recommended background: Basic knowledge of differential and integral calculus (e.g. MA 1021 and MA 1022 or equivalent), human biology (e.g., BB 1025 or equivalent), and chemistry (e.g. CH 1010 and CH1020 or equivalent).\", \"req\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"1021\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"1022\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"1025\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"1010\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"1020\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
