{"title": "TIME SERIES ANALYSIS", "level": "550", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Time series are collections of observations made \nsequentially in time. Examples of this type of data\nabound in many fields ranging from finance to engineering. Special techniques are called for in\n order to analyze and model these data. This course \nintroduces the student to time and frequency\n domain techniques, including topics such as \nautocorrelation, spectral analysis, and ARMA\n and ARIMA models, Box-Jenkins methodology,\n fitting, forecasting, and seasonal adjustments.\n Time permitting, additional topics will be chosen \nfrom: Kalman filter, smoothing techniques, \nHolt-Winters procedures, FARIMA and GARCH\n models, and joint time-frequency methods such \nas wavelets. The emphasis will be in application \nto real data situations using statistical computer\n packages. (Prerequisite: knowledge of MA 511 is\n assumed. Knowledge of MA 541 is also assumed, \nbut may be taken concurrently.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
