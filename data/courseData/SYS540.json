"{\"title\": \"INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMS THINKING\", \"level\": \"540\", \"abbreviation\": \"SYS\", \"description\": \"Systems Thinking provides an arsenal of tools that enable program managers and systems engineers to better identify, understand, and control systems, and to improve their performance. In this course, we will study system identification and delineation, causal loops and feedback, system leverage points, delays and oscillations, mental models and unintended consequences, emergent properties,\\npatterns, events, and self- organization, and use these tools to improve the performance of engineering, biological, business, and complex social systems. We will explore great system failures, how they might have been avoided, and how we can learn from them in developing and participating in current systems. Finally, we will learn how systems thinking explains the conflicting behavior of individuals, departments, businesses, and countries.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
