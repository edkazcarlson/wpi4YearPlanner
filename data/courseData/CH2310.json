The course will provide a representative collection of characteristic\n reactions and transformations of a variety of types of organic molecules. Most of \nthe examples will be drawn from aliphatic chemistry. Some theoretical models \nwill be introduced with a view toward establishing a general overview of the\n material.\n \n\nThe course is intended for chemists, chemical engineers, pre-medical students \nand all those interested in the biosciences. A familiarity with the material\n presented in the general chemistry courses is assumed.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
