"{\"title\": \"TECHNICAL ART AND CHARACTER RIGGING\", \"level\": \"2048\", \"abbreviation\": \"IMGD\", \"description\": \"This course will focus on making digital art functional in a video game environment. Students will learn the skills necessary to create and optimize their art assets through several creative and technical solutions that are all geared towards making high quality game art.\\n     This course will allow students to form a greater understanding of the bridge between pure art creation and interactive art implementation into a game engine. The course explores the many problems and technical restrictions one is faced with when trying to implement anything from animated characters to textures and focuses on how one can creatively apply technology to achieve high quality results.\\n     Topics covered include: creating complex character rigs, optimizing character meshes for rigging, shader creation, optimizing UV space and baking texture files and lighting.\\n     Recommended background: Basic knowledge of 3D modeling, texturing and animation (IMGD 2101 and IMGD 2201 or equivalent).\\n     Students may not receive credit for both IMGD 204X and IMGD 2048.\", \"req\": [[[\"IMGD\"], [\"2101\"]], [[\"IMGD\"], [\"2201\"]], [[\"IMGD\"], [\"204X\"]], [[\"IMGD\"], [\"2048\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
