I (1/6 unit)\n \nThrough a research-based laboratory and short lectures, students will learn the basic principles of image formation, resolution, and digital imaging. Students will develop confidence in the use of light microscopy and be able to apply different modes of microscopy to solve biological problems. This course emphasizes a quantitative approach to microscopy and digital imaging applied toward simple phenotypic analysis. Students will develop scientific writing skills and learn how to prepare professional quality images. \n\nRecommended background: a working knowledge of laboratory techniques in molecular biology, and microbiology (BB 2901 or equivalent), and concepts in cell biology (BB 2550 or equivalent).\n\nStudents may not recieve credit for both BB 324X and BB 3524", "req": [[["BB"], ["2901"]], [["BB"], ["2550"]], [["BB"], ["324X"]], [["BB"], ["3524"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
