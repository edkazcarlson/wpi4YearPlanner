"{\"title\": \"BIOMATERIALS IN THE DESIGN OF MEDICAL DEVICES\", \"level\": \"531\", \"abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"description\": \"Biomaterials are an integral part of medical devices, \\nimplants, controlled drug delivery systems, and \\ntissue engineered constructs. Extensive research\\n efforts have been expended on understanding\\n how biologic systems interact with biomaterials. \\nMeanwhile, controversy has revolved around \\nbiomaterials and their availability as a result of \\nthe backlash to the huge liability resulting from \\ncontroversies related to material and processing\\n shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically\\n addresses the unique role of biomaterials \\nin medical device design and the use of emerging \\nbiomaterials technology in medical devices. The\\n need to understand design requirements of medical\\ndevices based on safety and efficacy will be \\naddressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if\\n testing fails to account for synergistic interactions \\nfrom chronic loading, aqueous environments,\\n and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies\\n are readily available to assess accelerated effects of \\nloading in physiologic-like environments. This \\ncombined with subchronic effects of animal implants \\nis a potential tool in assessing durability. It \\nis difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total \\nbiologic environment. The ultimate determination\\n of safety comes not only from following the\\n details of regulations, but with an understanding\\n of potential failure modes and designs that lowers \\nthe risk of these failures. This course will evaluate\\n biomaterials and their properties as related to the\\ndesign and reliability of medical devices.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
