I\\nThrough a combination of lectures and in class discussion, students will learn and understand the essential concept of molecular biology, including the mechanisms by which information stored in nucleic acids is maintained and processed in living systems. An evolutionary framework will help illustrate how genomes are structured and how they change. Basic regulatory mechanisms of gene expression will be addressed, with emphasis in eukaryotic gene regulatory proteins. The concepts learned in this course will provide the foundation to continue exploring this rapidly expanding field. \\n\\nRecommended background: BB 1035 (Biotechnology) or equivalent\", \"req\": [[[\"BB\"], [\"1035\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
