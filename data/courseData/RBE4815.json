I\\n \\nThis course introduces students to robotics within manufacturing systems. \\nTopics include: classification of robots, robot kinematics, motion generation and\\n transmission, end effectors, motion accuracy, sensors, robot control and automation. This course is a combination of lecture, laboratory and project\\n work, and utilizes industrial robots. Through the laboratory work, students will \\nbecome familiar with robotic programming (using a robotic programming \\nlanguage VAL II) and the robotic teaching mode. The experimental component\\n of the laboratory exercise measures the motion and positioning capabilities of \\nrobots as a function of several robotic variables and levels, and it includes the use \\nof experimental design techniques and analysis of variance. \\nRecommended background: manufacturing (ME 1800), kinematics (ME 3310), \\ncontrol (ES 3011), and computer programming.\", \"req\": [[[\"ME\"], [\"1800\"]], [[\"ME\"], [\"3310\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3011\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
