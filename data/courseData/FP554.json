"{\"title\": \"ADVANCED FIRE SUPPRESSION\", \"level\": \"554\", \"abbreviation\": \"FP\", \"description\": \"Advanced topics in suppression systems analysis and design are discussed with an aim toward developing a performance-based understanding of suppression technology. Automatic sprinkler systems are covered from the standpoint of predicting actuation times, reviewing numerical methods for hydraulic analyses of pipe flow networks and understanding the phenomenology involved in water spray suppression. Special suppression systems are covered from the standpoint of two-phase and non-Newtonian pipe flow and simulations of suppression agent discharge and mixing in an enclosure.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
