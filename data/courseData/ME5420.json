"{\"title\": \"FUNDAMENTALS OF AXIOMATIC DESIGN OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES\", \"level\": \"5420\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"This on-line only, seven week, two credit course includes an in-depth study of axiomatic design, the theory and practice.  Applications are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is based on the premise that there are common aspects to all good designs.  These commons aspects, stated in the independence and information axioms, facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline.  Analysis of processes and products is considered from the perspective of supporting product and process design.  Fundamental methods of engineering analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are developed.  Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces.  The ability to generalize is emphasized to facilitate development of analyses and design methods with broader applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. The grade is from performance on homework and quizzes given and delivered on-line and on a design project on manufacturing processes.  Projects can be from work or dissertations on many kinds of systems and services, in addition to traditional manufacturing processes and tools.  Credit cannot be given for this course and any of the similar, in-class versions for 3 credits, MFE520, MTE520 and ME543.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
