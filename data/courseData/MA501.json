{"title": "ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS", "level": "501", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "This course develops mathematical techniques \nused in the engineering disciplines. Preliminary\nconcepts will be reviewed as necessary, including\n vector spaces, matrices and eigen values. The principal\n topics covered will include vector calculus, \nFourier transforms, fast Fourier transforms and\nLaplace transformations. Applications of these\n techniques for the solution of boundary value and\n initial value problems will be given. The problems \ntreated and solved in this course are typical of \nthose seen in applications and include problems \nof heat conduction, mechanical vibrations and\n wave propagation. (Prerequisite: A knowledge of\n ordinary differential equations, linear algebra and\n multivariable calculus is assumed.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
