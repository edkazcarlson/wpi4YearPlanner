"{\"title\": \"SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND DESIGN IN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\", \"level\": \"4400\", \"abbreviation\": \"DEV\", \"description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis course provides students with a set of skills that will allow them to address complex problems and design challenges in development engineering. Students will learn to participate in and lead innovation and creativity in collaborative settings. This course includes design projects and case studies, many related to projects at WPI. Student teams will work with preliminary data to define the problem. They will then collect and analyze interview and survey data to learn about user needs. Students will explore how to understand end-user needs. Students will use a variety of tools to analyze their data, ideate potential solutions, and prototype. The teams will use their projects to develop plans for rapid improvement, scaling, continuous improvement and a rigorous impact evaluation.\\nRecommended background: None.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": -1}"
