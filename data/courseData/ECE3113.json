{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO RF CIRCUIT DESIGN", "level": "3113", "abbreviation": "ECE", "description": "Cat. I\n \nThis course is designed to provide students with the basic principles of radio\nfrequency (RF) circuit design. It concentrates on topics such as designing tuning\n and matching networks for analog and digital communication, satellite \nnavigation, and radar systems.\n \nAfter reviewing equivalent circuit representations for RF diodes, transistors,\nFETs, and their input/output impedance behavior, the course examines the \ndifference between lumped and distributed parameter systems. Characteristics \nimpedance, standing waves, reflection coefficients, insertion loss, and group \ndelay of RF circuits will be explained.\n \nWithin the context of Maxwell\u2019s theory the course will then focus on the\ngraphical display of the reflection coefficient (Smith Chart) and its importance \nin designing matching circuits. Students will learn the difference between SPICE\n and monolithic and microwave integrated circuit analysis, and design\n (MMICAD) modeling. Biasing and matching networks for single and \nmultistage amplifiers in the 900 to 2,000 MHz range are analyzed and \noptimized in terms of input/output impedance matching, insertion loss, and\n groups delays. \n\nRecommended background: ECE 2019, ECE 3204.\nSuggested background: ECE 2112.", "req": [[["ECE"], ["2019"]], [["ECE"], ["3204"]], [["ECE"], ["2112"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
