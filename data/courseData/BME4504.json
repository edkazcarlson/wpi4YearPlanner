I \\r\\nThis course emphasizes the applications of mechanics to describe the material properties of living tissues. It is concerned with the description and measurements of these properties as related to their physiological functions. Emphasis on the interrelationship between biomechanics and physiology in medicine, surgery, body injury and prostheses. Topics covered include: review of basic mechanics, stress, strain, constitutive equations and the field equations, viscoelastic behavior, and models of material behavior. The measurement and characterization of properties of tendons, skin, muscles and bone. Biomechanics as related to body injury and the design of prosthetic devices. \\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended background: mechanics (ES 2501, ES 2502, ES 2503, ME 3501), mathematics (MA 2051). \", \"req\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2502\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2503\"]], [[\"ME\"], [\"3501\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
