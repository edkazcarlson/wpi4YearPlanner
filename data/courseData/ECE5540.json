"{\"title\": \"POWER TRANSMISSION\", \"level\": \"5540\", \"abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"description\": \"This graduate level course focuses on the theory and current professional practice in problems of electric power transmission. It begins with a review of the theory of AC electric power transmission networks and addresses a range of challenges related to reactive power and voltage control as well as steady-state and transients stability. Students will learn in detail the principles of traditional reactive power compensation (shunt reactors and capacitors); series compensation and modern static reactive compensation like SVC, STATCOM and other Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices. The effects of each of these types of compensation on static and dynamic voltage control, reactive power requirement and steady-state and transient stability problems are covered from theoretical as well as practical aspects. Particular attention is given to the mathematical models and principles of operation of many types of compensation systems. Basic principles of operation and control of High-Voltage DC (HVDC) systems and their impact on steady-state and dynamics of power system will be covered as well. (Prerequisite: ECE 5500 Power System Analysis.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
