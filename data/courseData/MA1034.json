I \nThis course will cover the same material as MA1024 Calculus IV from a more mathematically rigorous perspective. The course gives a rigorous introduction of differentiation and integration for functions of one variable. After introducing vector functions, differentiation and integration will be extended to functions of several variables. \nRecommended background: Theoretical Calculus III (MA1033, or equivalent). \nNote: Students can receive credit for this class and MA1024 Calculus IV.", "req": [[["MA"], ["1033"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
