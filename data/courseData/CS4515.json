{"title": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "level": "4515", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "Cat. II\nThis course explores the architectural design of modern computer systems in \nterms of instruction sets and the organization of processors, controllers,\n memories, devices, and communication links. Topics include an overview of\ncomputer architectures and system components, theoretical foundations,\ninstruction-level and thread-level pipelining, multifunction pipelines, multi-core\nsystems, caching and memory hierarchies, and multi-core and parallel computer\norganization. Students may be expected to design and implement programs that\nsimulate significant components of modern computer architectures.\n     Recommended background: CS 2011 or ECE 2049, and CS 3013.\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["CS"], ["2011"]], [["ECE"], ["2049"]], [["CS"], ["3013"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
