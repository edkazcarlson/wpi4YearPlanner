"{\"Course Name\": \"ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"2799\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThe goal of this course is to provide experience with the design of a system,\\ncomponent, or process. Basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences\\n are applied to convert resources to meet a stated objective. Fundamental steps of \\nthe design process are practiced, including the establishment of objectives and \\ncriteria, synthesis, analysis, manufacturability, testing, and evaluation. Student \\nwork in small teams and are encouraged to use creativity to solve specific but \\nopen-ended problems, and then present their results.\\nECE 2799 is strongly recommended for all students as a preparation for the \\ndesign element of the MQP. It is anticipated that ECE 2799 will be of most \\nbenefit to students when taken well in advance of the MQP (late sophomore\\n year or early junior year).\\n \\nRecommended background: At least three of ECE 2019, ECE 2029, ECE 2049, ECE 2311.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ECE\"], [\"2019\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2029\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2049\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2311\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
