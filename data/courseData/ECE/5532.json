"{\"Course Name\": \"DISTRIBUTED AND RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION\", \"Course Level\": \"5532\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces the characteristics and challenges of interconnecting increasing numbers of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the Electric Power System (EPS).  Topics include: challenges to distribution and transmission system protection; local voltage control; ride through; optimal interconnection transformer configurations; and practical engineering approaches to maintain system reliability and protection. The current and evolving interconnection standard (IEEE 1547) is included. (Prerequisites:  ECE 5500 Power System Analysis plus either ECE 5520 Power System Protection and Control or ECE 5521 Protective Relaying.  ECE 5530 Power Distribution highly recommended.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
