"{\"Course Name\": \"INFORMATION THEORY AND CODING\", \"Course Level\": \"5311\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces the fundamentals of\\n information theory and discusses applications in \\ncompression and transmission of data. Measures\\n of information, including entropy, and their\\n properties are derived. The limits of loss less data \\ncompression are derived and practical coding \\nschemes approaching the theoretical limits are presented. \\nLossy data compression tradeoffs are discussed \\nin terms of the rate-distortion framework.\\n The concept of reliable communication through \\nnoisy channels (channel capacity) is developed.\\n Techniques for practical channel coding, including\\n block and convolutional codes, are also covered.\\n (Prerequisite: background in probability and random \\nprocesses such as in ECE 502 or equivalent).\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
