"{\"Course Name\": \"POWER SYSTEM DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"5523\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This graduate level course is concerned with modeling, analyzing and mitigating power system stability and control problems.  The course seeks to provide an understanding of the electromechanical dynamics of the interconnected electric power grid. This subject is presented from a theoretical viewpoint; however, many practical examples are included. The course begins with a description of the physics of the power system, frequency regulation during \\u201csteady-state\\u201d operation, dynamic characteristics of modern power systems, a review of feedback control systems, power system frequency regulation, and a review of protective relaying. This is followed by material on synchronous machine theory and modeling. Simulation of power system dynamic response, small signal stability, transient stability analysis using SIMULINK and effects of non-traditional power sources on systems dynamics will also be covered. Power system stabilizers, load modeling and under frequency load shedding are covered in the final lectures. \\n(Prerequisite: Familiarity with the basics of Laplace Transforms, derivatives, transfer functions, poles and zeros, block diagram and the notion of feedback with basic understanding power system analysis topics recommended. (ECE 5500 Power System Analysis and ECE 5511 Transients in Power Systems or equivalent background experience is suggested.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
