"{\"Course Name\": \"MODERN DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS\", \"Course Level\": \"5312\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces a rigorous analytical treatment\\n of modern digital communication systems,\\n including digital modulation, demodulation,\\n and optimal receiver design. Error performance \\nanalysis of these communication systems when \\noperating over either noisy or band-limited channels\\n will be conducted. Advanced topics to be \\ncovered include a subset of the following: MIMO, \\nfading channels, multiuser communications,\\n spread spectrum systems, and/or multicarrier \\ntransmission. (Prerequisites: An understanding of\\nprobability and random processes theory (ECE \\n502 or equivalent); an understanding of various\\n analog and digital (de)modulation techniques\\n (ECE 3311 or equivalent); familiarity with MATLAB \\nprogramming.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
