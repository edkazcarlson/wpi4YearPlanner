"{\"Course Name\": \"INTRODUCTION TO ANTENNA DESIGN\", \"Course Level\": \"5105\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course is intended for graduate and senior-level undergraduate students.  The course provides an introduction to major antennas and antenna types for wireless communications, electrical and biomedical sensors, and RF and MW engineering. Basic antenna characteristics are studied: polarization, directivity, gain, realized gain, and impedance bandwidth. Both narrowband and broadband antennas as well as linear and planar antenna arrays are considered. An emphasis is made on learning modern antenna modeling software\\u2013 ANSYS HFSS and Antenna Toolbox of MATLAB. The course structure is directed toward practical antenna design and enables senior undergraduate students to take this course. Course topics include: transmitter-receiver antenna circuit models, antenna radiation and radiation parameters, dipole antenna family, patch antenna family, loop antenna family, reflector antennas, small antennas, antenna matching and tuning, antenna arrays, on-body and in-body antennas. \\n     Prerequisites: undergraduate analog electronics, college MATLAB, and basic introductory knowledge of electromagnetic theory - ECE 2019 and ECE 3113 .\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
