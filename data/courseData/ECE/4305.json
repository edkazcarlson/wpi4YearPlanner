"{\"Course Name\": \"SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO SYSTEMS AND ANALYSIS\", \"Course Level\": \"4305\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I \\nThis course provides students with hands-on exposure to the design and\\nimplementation of modern digital communication systems using software-defined \\nradio technology. The prototyping and real-time experimentation of \\nthese systems via software-defined radio will enable greater flexibility in the\\n assessment of design trade-offs as well as the illustration of \\u201creal world\\u201d\\n  operational behavior. Performance comparisons with quantitative analytical\\n techniques will be conducted in order to reinforce digital communication system \\ndesign concepts. In addition to laboratory modules, a final course project will\\n synthesize topics covered in class. Course topics include software-defined radio\\n architectures and implementations, digital signaling and data transmission\\n analysis in noise, digital receiver structures (matched filtering, correlation),\\n multicarrier communication techniques, radio frequency spectrum sensing and\\nidentification (energy detection, matched filtering), and fundamentals of radio\\n resource management.\\n \\nRecommended background: ECE 3311, MA 2621, familiarity with Simulink,\\nfamiliarity with general programming.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ECE\"], [\"3311\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2621\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
