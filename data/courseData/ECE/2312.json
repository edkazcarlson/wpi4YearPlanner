"{\"Course Name\": \"DISCRETE-TIME SIGNAL AND SYSTEM ANALYSIS\", \"Course Level\": \"2312\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course provides an introduction to the time and frequency domain analysis of\\ndiscrete-time signals and linear systems. Topics include sampling and quantization,\\ncharacterization of discrete-time sequences, the discrete-time Fourier transform, the discrete Fourier transform and its applications, the Z transform and its applications, convolution, characterization of FIR and IIR discrete-time \\nsystems, and the analysis and design of discrete-time filters. The course will include a focus on applications such as sampling and quantization, audio processing, navigation systems, and communications. Extensive use will be made of simulation tools including Matlab.\\nRecommended background: MA 2051, ECE 2311 and a prior course in computer programming such as CS 2301 or CS 1101/2/4.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2311\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"2301\"]], [[\"CS\"], [\"1101\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
