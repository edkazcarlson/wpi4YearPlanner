"{\"Course Name\": \"ADVANCED SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE\", \"Course Level\": \"572\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This Course covers techniques such as caching, hierarchical memory, pipelining and parallelism, that are used to enhance the performance of computer systems. It compares and contrast different approaches to achieving high performance in machine ranging from advanced microprocessors to vector supercomputers (CRAY, CYBER). It also illustrates how these techniques are applied in massively parallel SIMD machines (DAP, Connection Machine). In each case the focus is on the combined hardware/ software performance achieved and the interaction between application demands and hardware/software capabilities. (Prerequisites: This course assumes the material covered in ECE 505. The student should also have a background in computer programming and operating systems (CS 502). Familiarity with basic probability and statistics such as ECE 502 or MA 541 is recommended.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
