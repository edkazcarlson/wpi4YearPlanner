"{\"Course Name\": \"MICROELECTRONIC CIRCUITS II\", \"Course Level\": \"3204\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course is the second of a two-course sequence in electronic circuit design. More \\ncomplex circuits are analyzed and the effects of frequency and feedback are considered\\n in detail. The course provides a comprehensive treatment of operational amplifier \\noperation and limitations. The use of Bode plots to describe the amplitude and phase\\n performance of circuits as a function of operating frequency is also presented. In\\naddition, the concepts of analog signal sampling, analog-to-digital conversion and \\ndigital-to-analog conversion are presented along with techniques for interfacing analog \\nand digital circuitry. Laboratory exercises are provided to reinforce student facility with\\n the application of these concepts to the design of practical circuits.\\nTopics include: transducers; differential amplifiers, inverting/non-inverting\\n amplifiers, summers, differentiators, integrators, passive and active filers, the \\nSchmitt trigger, monostable and a-stable oscillators, timers, sample-and-hold\\n circuits, A/D converters, and D/A converters. \\nRecommended background: Introductory electronic-circuit design and analogsignal\\n analysis as found in ECE 2201 and ECE 2311.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ECE\"], [\"2201\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2311\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
