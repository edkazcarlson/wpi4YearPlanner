"{\"Course Name\": \"ADVANCED BIPOLAR SOLID STATE DEVICES\", \"Course Level\": \"5905\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"The operation of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) will be explored in detail, resulting in thorough understanding of observed phenomena including second-order effects that limit device performance in practical integrated circuit applications.  The course begins with a review of semiconductor fundamentals and p-n junction behavior, followed by extension to the BJT, with an emphasis on effects such as temperature dependence of operation parameters, deviations from ideal behavior at high and low voltages and currents, and failure modes such as zener and avalanche breakdown.  BJT behavior will be modeled for large and small signals under DC, AC, and transient conditions. Results from theoretical hand-analysis equations will be correlated with model parameters in software tools such as SPICE. Implications of fabrication technology including device scaling in submicron processes will be considered.  This course is intended for students pursuing study in either integrated circuit design or device physics. \\n(Prerequisite: undergraduate analog electronics).\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
