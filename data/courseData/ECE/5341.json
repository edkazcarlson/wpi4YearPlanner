"{\"Course Name\": \"APPLIED MEDICAL SIGNAL ANALYSIS\", \"Course Level\": \"5341\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course provides a broad introduction to medical signal analysis, particularly tailored to students who have no prior background in physiology or medicine.  The course will concentrate on signal analysis of the electrical activity of the human body, providing sufficient physiologic background for study of the relevant organ systems.  System-level engineering models of the electrical activity of the heart, skeletal muscles and brain will be presented and actual physiologic signals will be analyzed.  Digital signal processing algorithms for analysis of these signals will be studied extensively using MATLAB.  Specific signal processing topics may include: use of muscle electrical activity to command powered prostheses and/or guide rehabilitation therapy; design of filters to reject motion artifact, noise and interference; monitoring (e.g., detection and classification) of heart, brain and muscle electrical impulses; and non-invasive estimation of muscle activation level. Students may not receive credit for ECE 5341 and either ECE 443X or ECE 539D. \\n     Prerequisites: Undergraduate (or graduate) course in digital signal processing, experience with MATLAB and a course in probability.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
