"{\"Course Name\": \"SENSORS, CIRCUITS, AND SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"2019\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course investigates commonly used sensors such as resistive temperature\\nsensors, capacitive touch sensors, and inductive motion sensors and actuators.\\n Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental\\n operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and \\ninductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits\\n and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of \\nKirchhoff \\u2018s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as\\n Thevenin and Norton\\u2019s theorems and the superposition principle are used to\\n model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of \\nlinear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as \\nnecessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters \\nin both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain \\n(rise time, step response). Capacitance, inductance and mutual inductance are \\nexplored as energy storage elements, including consideration of resonance and \\nenergy losses in power systems. Concepts will be reinforced with the use of \\nlaboratory exercises and computer simulation. \\nRecommended background: ECE 2010, MA 1024 (or equivalent),\\n PH 1120/21 and MA 2051 (concurrent) \\nNote: Students who have received credit for ECE 2111 may not receive credit\\n for ECE 2019.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"ECE\"], [\"2010\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"1024\"]], [[\"PH\"], [\"1120\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2111\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2019\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
