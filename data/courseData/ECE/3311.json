"{\"Course Name\": \"PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS\", \"Course Level\": \"3311\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThis course provides an introduction to analog and digital communications \\nsystems. The bandpass transmission of analog data is motivated and typical\\nsystems are analyzed with respect to bandwidth considerations and implementation\\n techniques. Baseband and passband digital transmission systems are \\nintroduced and investigated. Pulse shaping and intersymbol interference criteria\\nare developed in relation to the pulse rate transmission limits of bandlimited\\nchannels. Finally, digital carrier systems and line coding are introduced in\\nconjunction with applications to modern modem transmission schemes.\\n \\nRecommended background: MA 1024 and ECE 2312.\\n \\nSuggested background: ECE 2305.\", \"Requirements\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"1024\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2312\"]], [[\"ECE\"], [\"2305\"]]], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
