"{\"Course Name\": \"WIRELESS ACCESS AND LOCALIZATION\", \"Course Level\": \"5307\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course covers the fundamentals of the evolving wireless localization techniques and their relation with the wireless access infrastructures for Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science or other graduate students interested in this field.  The course begins with an explanation of the common ground among wireless access and localization techniques which are principles of waveform transmission in multipath rich urban and indoor areas and the deployment of the infrastructure for wireless networks.  This is followed by the fundamentals of received signal strength (RSS) and Time- and Angle-of-arrival (TOA/AOA) based localization techniques, addressing applications, systems, effects of environment, performance bounds and algorithms.  The course describes how wireless access methods used in wide, local and personal area networks are related to localization techniques using cellular, UWB, WiFi, and other signals of opportunity as well as mechanical sensors used in different smart phone and Robotic platforms.  The emphasis on the effects of environment is on the analysis of the effects of multipath on precision of the localization techniques.  The emphasis on performance evaluation is on the derivation of Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).  For algorithms, the course describes fingerprinting algorithms used for RSS-based localization and super-resolution, cooperative localization, localization using multi-carrier transmission and localization using multipath diversity as well as Kalman and Particle filtering techniques used for model based localization.  Examples of emerging technologies in Body Area Networking and Robotics applications are provided. \\n     Prerequisite: ECE506, CS513, or equivalent familiarity with local and wide area networks.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
