"{\"Course Name\": \"MODELING AND SYNTHESIS OF DIGITAL SYSTEMS USING VERILOG AND VHDL\", \"Course Level\": \"574\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This is an introductory course on Verilog and\\n VHDL, two standard hardware description languages \\n(HDLs), for students with no background\\n or prior experience with HDLs. In this course \\nwe will examine some of the important features \\nof Verilog and VHDL. The course will enable\\n students to design, simulate, model and synthesize\\n digital designs. The dataflow, structural, and \\nbehavioral modeling techniques will be discussed\\n and related to how they are used to design combinational\\n and sequential circuits. The use of test\\nbenches to exercise and verify the correctness of \\nhardware models will also be described. Course\\n Projects: Course projects will involve the modeling\\n and sysntesis and testing of systems using\\n Xilinx tools. We will be targeting Xilinx FPGA\\n and CPLDs. Students will need to purchase a \\nFPGA or CPLD development board for project\\nassignments. (Other VHDL tools may be used \\nif these are available to the student at their place\\n of employment.) Students will have the choice \\nof completing assignments in either Verilog or\\n VHDL. (Prerequisites: Logic Circuits and experience \\nwith programming in a high-level language \\n(such as C or Pascal) and a computer architecture \\ncourse such as ECE 505.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
