"{\"Course Name\": \"COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE\", \"Course Level\": \"505\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"Course Description\": \"This course introduces the fundamentals of computer\\n system architecture and organization. Topics \\ninclude CPU structure and function, addressing \\nmodes, instruction formats, memory system \\norganization, memory mapping and hierarchies,\\n concepts of cache and virtual memories, storage\\n systems, standard local buses, high-performance\\nI/O, computer communication, basic principles of \\noperating systems, multiprogramming, multiprocessing, \\npipelining and memory management. The \\narchitecture principles underlying RISC and CISC\\n processors are presented in detail. The course also \\nincludes a number of design projects, including \\nsimulating a target machine, architecture using \\na high-level language (HLL). (Prerequisites: \\nUndergraduate course in logic circuits and microprocessor\\n system design, as well as proficiency \\nin assembly language and a structured high-level\\n language such as C or Pascal.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
