{"title": "CONTROL OF NONLINEAR DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS", "level": "5221", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "(2 Credits)\nOverview of stability concepts and examination of various methods for assessing stability such as linearization and Lyapunov methods. Introduction to various design\nmethods based on linearization, sliding modes, adaptive control, and feedback linearization. Demonstration and performance analysis on engineering systems such as flexible robotic manipulators, mobile robots, spacecraft attitude control and aircraft control systems. Control synthesis and analysis is performed using Matlab/Simulink.\n     Prerequisites: Familiarity with ordinary differential equations, introductory control theory at the undergraduate level, fundamentals of linear algebra. Familiarity with Matlab is strongly recommended. Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics (ME 593N) version of the same course or ME 5203.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
