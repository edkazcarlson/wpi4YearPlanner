"{\"title\": \"ENGINEERING EXPERIMENTATION\", \"level\": \"3901\", \"abbreviation\": \"ME\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nA course designed to develop analytical and experimental skills in modern\\n engineering measurement methods, based on electronic instrumentation and \\ncomputer-based data acquisition systems. The lectures are concerned with the \\nengineering analysis and design as well as the principles of instrumentation,\\n whereas the laboratory periods afford the student an opportunity to use modern \\ndevices in actual experiments. \\n\\nLecture topics include: review of engineering fundamentals and, among\\n others, discussions of standards, measurement and sensing devices, experiment\\n planning, data acquisition, analysis of experimental data, and report writing. \\n\\nLaboratory experiments address both mechanical and thermal systems and \\ninstrumentation in either traditional mechanical engineering (heat transfer, flow \\nmeasurement/visualization, force/torque/strain measurement, motion/vibration\\n measurement) or materials engineering (temperature and pressure measurements \\nin materials processing, measurement of strain and position in mechanical\\n testing of materials). Each year students will be notified which type of \\nexperiments will be used in each term offering. Students may also consult with\\n their academic advisor or the Mechanical Engineering department office.\\n \\n     Recommended background: mathematics (MA 2051), thermo-fluids (ES \\n3001, ES 3003, ES 3004), mechanics (ES 2501, ES 2502, ES 2503 or equivalent), materials \\n(ES 2001 or equivalent).\", \"req\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2051\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3001\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3003\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"3004\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2501\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2502\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2503\"]], [[\"ES\"], [\"2001\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
