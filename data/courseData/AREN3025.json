"{\"title\": \"BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION\", \"level\": \"3025\", \"abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\nThe course addresses the basic principles of building energy simulation, with a focus on the practical applications of building energy simulation tools to building design. Topics being covered include various model input parameters such as building geometry, orientation, climate, comfort, zoning, material properties, operation schedules, and HVAC systems. Building energy simulation software packages are illustrated and applied to the analysis of various case studies of\\nbuildings. Simulation output results are critically analyzed and compared to the results obtained from other building energy calculation methods.\\n     Recommended background: building physics (AREN 3024 or equivalent)\", \"req\": [[[\"AREN\"], [\"3024\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
