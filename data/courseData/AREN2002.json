"{\"title\": \"ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN I\", \"level\": \"2002\", \"abbreviation\": \"AREN\", \"description\": \"This course offers an introduction to the architectural design process by exploring the relations between materials, structures, spaces, and architectural composition. Studio: The studio design component explores the syntax of architecture, siting, context, and human scale. Students will engage these topics through architectural design studies for a project of limited scope and programmatic complexity. Hand drawing and sketching, modeling and visualization software, orthographic drawings, and physical models are used to explore, develop, and communicate architectural design concepts. Lectures / lab: The lecture/lab component of the course focuses on two-dimensional drawing techniques (including hand drawings and sketching), drawing conventions, and architectural representation techniques. Students are introduced to the fundamental uses of modeling software in engineering and architectural design practice. Advanced topics may include three dimensional modeling rendering, animation, and parametric design. \\nThis course uses studio, lecture, and lab based teaching methods \\nRecommended background: None\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
