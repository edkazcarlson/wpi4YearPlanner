{"title": "ADVENTURES IN SUSTAINABLE URBANISM", "level": "3100", "abbreviation": "ENV", "description": "This course will take students on an adventure, both in the class and in the field. Students will examine the history of sustainable development, its antecedents, the factors that have influenced its evolution, and how the sustainable city came into existence. Students will be invited on a number of virtual field trips to sustainable cities from around the world. The goal will be to explore the underlying factors of sustainable urbanism, why it looks the way it does in different places, and how students can exercise their own agency in developing alternatives. Students will also develop their own field trips for publication on the course website. \n  Suggested background: introduction to environmental studies and a passion for urban exploration.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
