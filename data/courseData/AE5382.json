{"title": "AEROELASTICITY", "level": "5382", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "(2 Credits)\nAeroelastic phenomena arise from the interaction between a fluid and a structure. Such phenomena are encountered in  aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering systems. Topics covered include: aeroelastic phenomena in nature, divergence and control effectiveness in static conditions, static and dynamic instabilities of elastic bodies in a flow, flutter of wings, and aeroelastic testing techniques. Students will be introduced to analytical and   computational techniques used to model and simulate aeroelasticity. \nStudents cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics (ME 593N) version of the same course.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
