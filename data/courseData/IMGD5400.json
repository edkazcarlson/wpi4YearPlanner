{"title": "PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT FOR INTERACTIVE MEDIA", "level": "5400", "abbreviation": "IMGD", "description": "This course focuses on the process of creating a set of documents encompassing the design and vision of a piece of interactive media, methods for structuring the implementation of the design, and tools for successfully managing the project. Students will analyze different types of design documents, focusing on form and purpose while also considering audience and publication medium. Students will write design documents, give peer feedback, and revise their own documents based on feedback received. In order to see their design transform from document to product, students will study different project management methods and employ them, defining in detail discrete components, timelines, milestones, players and their responsibilities, and status reports to stakeholders. Tools common to managing interactive media projects (e.g., source-code revision control, asset management, scheduling) will be used throughout the process. \n\n(Prerequisites: Experience working on development projects)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
