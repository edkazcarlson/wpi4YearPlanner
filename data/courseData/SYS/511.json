"{\"Course Name\": \"SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, VERIFICATION & VALIDATION\", \"Course Level\": \"511\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"SYS\", \"Course Description\": \"This course examines the use of Systems Engineering principles and best practices with respect to systems and systems-of-systems verification and validation (V&V). V&V processes, activities and methods as they apply across the product lifecycle will be examined. Case studies, papers and exercises will be used to examine the success and failure of verification, validation and test processes. Course topics include 1) How early systems engineering activities and solution sets affect integration, verification, validation and test; 2) V&V activities relative to product development phases; 3) Modeling quality, cost, time and risk; 4) Testing and non-testing methods; 5) V&V planning, execution and reporting; 6) Systems integration; and 7) V&V of critical and complex systems.\\n(Prerequisite: SYS 501 Concepts of Systems Engineering)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
