The course starts with the \\nintroduction of metrics of risk such as volatility,\\n value-at-risk and expected shortfall and with \\nthe fundamental quantitative techniques used in\\nfinancial risk evaluation and management. The\\n next section is devoted to market risk including\\n volatility modeling, time series, non-normal heavy \\ntailed phenomena and multivariate notions of\\n co-dependence such as copulas, correlations and \\ntail-dependence. The final section concentrates \\non credit risk including structural and dynamic \\nmodels and default contagion and applies the \\nmathematical tools to the valuation of default\\ncontingent claims including credit default swaps,\\n structured credit portfolios and collateralized debt\\nobligations.
