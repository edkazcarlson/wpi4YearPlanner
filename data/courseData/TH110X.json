"{\"title\": \"ACTING: CONTEMPORARY STYLES\", \"level\": \"110X\", \"abbreviation\": \"TH\", \"description\": \"How does one explore a theatrical world physically and emotionally with language and find emotional truth? This class will explore foundational acting techniques drawn from the teachings and legacy of Konstantin Stanislavski (1863 \\u2013 1938), a Russian actor, director, producer and founder of the Moscow Art Theatre. His \\u201cStanislavski Method\\u201d is one of the most influential acting approaches in the 20th\\r\\nand 21st centuries. This approach will include analysis and exploration \\u201con our feet\\u201d of such terms as unit, objective, subtext, action, among others, as well as focus on incorporating characterization and given circumstances. We will do this through in-class exercises, as well as monologue and scenework\\u00a0\\r\\nonstage and on video from a variety of texts that employ naturalistic language (for example, Anton Chekhov\\u2019s The Seagull, Tennessee William\\u2019s The Glass Menagerie, Lynn Nottage\\u2019s Sweat, and Theresa Rebeck\\u2019s Mauritius, among others.) Further, we will explore the historical and social background of these playwrights in order to contextualize the ideas and mores behind the drama. Additionally, each actor will be expected to do research in order to better prepare themselves to dive into these theatrical worlds. Beyond acting skills, the student will learn valuable skills in public speaking and in conveying clear, complex ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended background: Some theatre or acting experience is desirable but the course is suitable for anyone with interest in the subject.\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
