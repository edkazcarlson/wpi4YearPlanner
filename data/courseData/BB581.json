{"title": "BIOINFORMATICS", "level": "581", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "(3 Credits)\nThis course will provide an overview of bioinformatics,\n covering a broad selection of the most \nimportant techniques used to analyze biological\n sequence and expression data. Students will \nacquire a working knowledge of bioinformatics\n applications through hands-on use of software to\n ask and answer biological questions. In addition, \nthe course will provide students with an introduction\n to the theory behind some of the most \nimportant algorithms used to analyze sequence\n data (for example, alignment algorithms and the \nuse of hidden Markov models). Topics covered\n will include protein and DNA sequence alignments, \nevolutionary analysis and phylogenetic \ntrees, obtaining protein secondary structure from \nsequence, and analysis of gene expression including \nclustering methods. (Prerequisite: knowledge \nof genetics, molecular biology, and statistics at the\nundergraduate level.) Students may not receive\n credit for both BB 581 and BB 4801.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
