"{\"title\": \"MODELING OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IN ELECTRICAL & BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS\", \"level\": \"5106\", \"abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"description\": \"This course is intended for graduate and senior-level undergraduate students. Modern numerical methods and major software packages are reviewed in application to modeling electrical and biomedical sensors, bioelectromagnetics, wireless communications (including wireless body area networks), and power electronics. The course begins with an introduction to computational mesh generation. Triangular surface meshes, volumetric tetrahedral meshes, voxel meshes, and computational human phantoms are studied. The boundary element method or the method-of-moments is introduced and detailed, followed by a review of the finite element method for electromagnetic problems. The finite-difference time-domain method is another major topic of the course. The course also covers ray tracing algorithms in application to wireless networks.         Prerequisites: college MATLAB, differential and integral calculus.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
