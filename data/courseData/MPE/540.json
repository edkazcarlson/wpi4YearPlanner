"{\"Course Name\": \"DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN NATURE\", \"Course Level\": \"540\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"MPE\", \"Course Description\": \"Emphasizes connections and interconnections\\n with the mechanical, electromagnetic, and \\nmodern areas as well as mathematical areas of \\noscillations, waves, and optics utilizing differential\\n equations at a level appropriate for secondary \\nschool educators. Topics include: Free, damped, \\nand driven-damped oscillations, waves, Doppler\\n Effect, optics, interference and diffraction. \\nExamples are drawn from a wide range of physical\\n phenomena to illustrate each concept. To develop\\n this content, homogeneous and non-homogeneous\\n differential equations of the first and second \\norder will be employed. Thick contextual meaning\\n will be drawn to support mathematical foundation \\nand vice versa to allow for deeper \\\"authentic\\\" \\nlearning.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
