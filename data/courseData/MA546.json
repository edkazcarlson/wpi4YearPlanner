{"title": "DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTS", "level": "546", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Controlled experiments\u2014studies in which treatments\n are assigned to observational units\u2014are the \ngold standard of scientific investigation. The goal \nof the statistical design and analysis of experiments\n is to (1) identify the factors which most affect a \ngiven process or phenomenon; (2) identify the\n ways in which these factors affect the process or \nphenomenon, both individually and in combination; \n(3) accomplish goals 1 and 2 with minimum\n cost and maximum efficiency while maintaining \nthe validity of the results. Topics covered in this\n course include the design, implementation and \nanalysis of completely randomized complete \nblock, nested, split plot, Latin square and repeated\n measures designs. Emphasis will be on the application \nof the theory to real data using statistical computer packages. (Prerequisite: knowledge of \nbasic probability and statistics at the level of\n MA 511 is assumed.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
