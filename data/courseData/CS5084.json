{"title": "INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHMS: DESIGN AND ANALYSIS", "level": "5084", "abbreviation": "CS", "description": "This course is an introduction to the design,\n analysis and proofs of correctness of algorithms. \nExamples are drawn from algorithms for many areas.\n Analysis techniques include asymptotic worst\n case and average case, as well as amortized analysis.\nAverage case analysis includes the development of\n a probability model. Techniques for proving lower\nbounds on complexity are discussed, along with\n NP-completeness. Prerequisites: an undergraduate\n knowledge of discrete mathematics and data\nstructures. Note: students with a strong background \nin design and analysis of computer systems, at the \nlevel equal to a BS in computer science, should not \ntake CS 5084 and should consider taking\n CS 504 or CS 584.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
