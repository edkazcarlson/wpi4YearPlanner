I \n\nThis course deals in a general way with the interactions between energy and\nmolecules, and considers how energetic and structural considerations affect the\n outcome of molecular interactions. The manipulation of kinetic data and results\nis stressed. Selected topics from both organic and inorganic chemistry are\n analyzed in terms of reaction thermodynamics, rates and mechanisms.\n \nStudents are expected to be familiar with thermodynamics, equilibria, reaction \nrates and the Periodic Table of the elements.\nThe following three courses, CH 4110, CH 4120, and CH 4130, are a three-term\n sequence intended to provide a strong emphasis in biochemistry. As\n background for this sequence, CH 1010, CH 1020, CH 1030, CH 1040, CH\n 2310, CH 2320, and CH 2330, or their equivalents, are recommended.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
