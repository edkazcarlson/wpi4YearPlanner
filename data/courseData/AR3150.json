"{\"title\": \"LIGHT, VISION AND UNDERSTANDING\", \"level\": \"3150\", \"abbreviation\": \"AR\", \"description\": \"Cat. II\\nBy using material from the sciences and the humanities, this course examines the\\nways in which ideas of knowledge and of human nature have been fashioned. \\nThe specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and\\n psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices \\nconcerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic \\ndisciplines is deliberate, and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits \\nare \\u201cnaturally\\u201d arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The\\n course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to\\n examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge\\n and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this\\n process. \\n\\nLight, Vision and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse\\n collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different\\nfields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of\\nnumerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual\\n perception. The course can fit into several Humanities and Arts topic areas as \\nwell as serve as a starting point for an IQP. There are no specific requirements \\nfor this course, although some knowledge of college-level physics, as well an \\nacquaintance with the visual arts, is helpful.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": \"2016\"}"
