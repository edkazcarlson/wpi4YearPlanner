{"title": "DISTRIBUTION-FREE AND ROBUST STATISTICAL METHODS", "level": "552", "abbreviation": "MA", "description": "Distribution-free statistical methods relax the \nusual distributional modeling assumptions of \nclassical statistical methods. Robust methods are \nstatistical procedures that are relatively insensitive \nto departures from typical assumptions, while\n retaining the expected behavior when assumptions \nare satisfied. Topics covered include, time\n permitting, order statistics and ranks; classical\n distribution-free tests such as the sign, Wilcoxon \nsigned rank, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and associated\n point estimators and confidence intervals; \ntests pertaining to one and two-way layouts; the\n Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; permutation methods; \nbootstrap and Monte Carlo methods; M, L, and \nR estimators, regression, kernel density estimation\n and other smoothing methods. Comparisons will\n be made to standard parametric methods. (Prerequisite:\nknowledge of MA 541 is assumed, but may \nbe taken concurrently.)", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
