{"title": "THE CONTEMPORARY SHORT STORY", "level": "225X", "abbreviation": "EN", "description": "Edgar Allan Poe, one of the short story genre\u2019s first practitioners, noted two traits of the story: its ability to be read in a single sitting and its unity of effect. Nearly two centuries later, short story writers worldwide harness techniques of maximalism, minimalism, metafiction, realism, and the literary fantastic to convey unique creative visions. This course will examine ways that contemporary writers push the boundaries of the form while retaining its twin hallmarks of brevity and compression. Students will engage the stories they read through short written responses and a critical or creative final project. Writers studied might include Poe, Maupassant, Chekhov, Carver, Rushdie, Danticat, Murakami, Pelevin, Moore, Xue, and Oyeymi. \n  Recommended Background: Coursework in Creative Writing / English, which might include topics such as fiction writing, creative nonfiction writing, or literature, particularly contemporary literature.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
