"{\"title\": \"SMART & SUSTAINABLE CITIES\", \"level\": \"130X\", \"abbreviation\": \"ENV\", \"description\": \"What is a smart and sustainable city? What shapes it? How does its history influence its future? How do physical forms and institutions vary from city to city, and how are these changes meaningful? How are cities changing, and what is the future of cities? This course explores these and other questions, focusing on international cities in the late twentieth century. Two areas of focus in this seminar are the physical patterns and socio-ecological processes underpinning urban change. On the one hand, cities are characterized by spatial patterns of grey and green infrastructure from downtown and inner city to suburb and edge city; on the other, they are driven by a host of social rules and norms, as well as dynamic and increasingly unpredictable ecological processes. These questions and more are explored through lectures, readings, videos, case studies, and guest speakers.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended background: None.\\r\\n\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
