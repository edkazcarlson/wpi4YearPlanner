"{\"title\": \"STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS\", \"level\": \"511\", \"abbreviation\": \"MTE\", \"description\": \"This course, (along with its companion course MTE 512 Properties and Performance of Engineering Materials), is designed to provide a comprehensive review of the fundamental principles of Materials Science and Engineering for incoming graduate students.  In the first part of this 2-set sequence, the structure in materials ranging from the sub-atomic to the macroscopic including nano, micro and macromolecular structures will be discussed to highlight bonding mechanisms, crystallinity and defect patterns. Representative thermodynamic and kinetic aspects such as diffusion, phase diagrams, nucleation and growth and TTT diagrams will be discussed.  Major structural parameters that effect of performance in materials including plastics, metallic alloys, ceramics and glasses will be emphasized.   The principal processing techniques to shape materials and the effects of processing on structure will be highlighted.   (Prerequisites: senior or graduate standing or consent of the instructor.)  Note: Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics version of the same course (MTE 594S).\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
