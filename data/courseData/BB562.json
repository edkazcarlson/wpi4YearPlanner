{"title": "CELL CYCLE REGULATION", "level": "562", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "(3 Credits)\nThis course focuses on molecular events that \nregulate cell cycle transitions and their relevance \nto mammalian differentiated and undifferentiated\ncells. Topics include control of the G1/S and\n G2/M transitions, relationships between tumor\n suppressor genes such as p16, Rb, p53 or oncogenes\n such as cyclin D, cdc25A, MDM2 or c-myc\n and cell cycle control. Where appropriate, the \nfocus is on understanding regulation of cell cycle \ncontrol through transcriptional induction of gene \nexpression, protein associations, posttranslational\n modifications like phosphorylation or regulation\n of protein stability like ubiquitin degradation.\n Students may receive credit for either BB 562 or a \nBB 570 course entitled Cell Cycle Regulation but\n not both.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
