{"title": "REACTOR DESIGN AND KINETICS", "level": "509", "abbreviation": "CHE", "description": "This course includes a review of prototypical chemical reactors, including design of batch, stirred tank, and tubular reactors. Theories of reaction kinetics and catalysis for simple and complex reactions are addressed. Reactor design is discussed within the context of complex transport phenomena and reaction kinetics, including effects of bulk and pore diffusion and multiphase reactions/reactors. Techniques for experimentation, reaction data treatment, catalyst preparation and characterization, and computational tools are also included. Students cannot receive credit for this course and CHE 506 or CHE 507, which this class replaces.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
