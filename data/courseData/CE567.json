"{\"title\": \"HAZARDOUS WASTE: CONTAINMENT, TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\", \"level\": \"567\", \"abbreviation\": \"CE\", \"description\": \"This course provides a survey of the areas associated \\nwith hazardous waste management. \\nThe course materials deal with identification of \\nhazardous waste legislation, containment, storage, transport, treatment and other hazardous wastes\\nmanagement issues. Topics include hazardous\\n movement and containment strategies, barrier \\ndesign considerations, hazardous waste risk assessment, \\nspill response and clean-up technologies,\\n centralized treatment facilities, on-site treatment,\\n in situ treatment, and industrial management and \\ncontrol measures. Design of selected containment\\n and treatment systems, and a number of industrial\\n case studies are also covered. This course is offered \\nto students with varying backgrounds. Students \\ninterested in taking this course must identify a\\n specific problem that deals with either regulation,\\n containment of hazardous waste, treatment of \\nhazardous waste or industrial source reduction of\\nhazardous waste. This problem becomes the focal\\n point for in-depth study. The arrangement of topics \\nbetween the students and the instructor must \\nbe established by the third week. A knowledge of\\n basic chemistry is assumed.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
