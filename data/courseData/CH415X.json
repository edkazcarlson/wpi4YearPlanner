"{\"title\": \"BIOPHOTONICS\", \"level\": \"415X\", \"abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"description\": \"This course has been designed to familiarize students with the theoretical and practical aspects of advanced biophotonic techniques, including FRET, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy measurements. In the synthetic part of the lab course, students will learn to link molecular structures with fluorescent properties. Cell based experiments will be used to study labeling of subcellular compartments using fluorescent probe molecules.  \\nRecommended background: experimental organic chemistry (CH2360 or CH2660) instrumental analysis (CH2640), and biochemistry (CH4110).\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"2360\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2660\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"2640\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"4110\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
