"{\"Course Name\": \"ROBOTICS ENGINEERING PRACTICUM\", \"Course Level\": \"596\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"RBE\", \"Course Description\": \"This practicum provides an opportunity to put into practice the principles studied in previous courses. It will generally be conducted off campus and will involve real-world robotics engineering. Overall conduct of the practicum will be supervised by a WPI RBE faculty member; an on-site liaison will direct day-to-day activity. For a student from industry, an internship may be sponsored by his or her employer. The project must include substantial analysis and/or design related to Robotics Engineering and will conclude with a substantial written report. A public oral presentation must also be made, to both the host organization and a committee consisting of the supervising faculty member, the on-site liaison and one additional WPI faculty member. This committee will verify successful completion of the internship. (Prerequisite: Consent of practicum faculty advisor.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
