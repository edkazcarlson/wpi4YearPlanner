"{\"Course Name\": \"ROBOT DYNAMICS\", \"Course Level\": \"501\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"RBE\", \"Course Description\": \"Foundations and principles of robotic manipulation.\\n Topics include computational models of \\nobjects and motion, the mechanics of robotic \\nmanipulators, the structure of manipulator control\\n systems, planning and programming of robot\\n actions. The focus of this class is on the kinematics \\nand programming of robotic mechanisms. \\nImportant topics also include the dynamics,\\n control, sensor and effector design, and automatic\\n planning methods for robots. The fundamental\\n techniques apply to arms, mobile robots,\\n active sensor platforms, and all other computer-controlled \\nkinematic linkages. The primary applications \\ninclude robotic arms and mobile robots \\nand lab projects would involve programming of\\n representative robots. An end of term team project\\n would allow students to program robots to participate \\nin challenges or competitions. (Prerequisite: \\nRBE 500 or equivalent.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
