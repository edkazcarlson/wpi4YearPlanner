{"title": "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND STATISTICS IN THE LIFE SCIENCES", "level": "553", "abbreviation": "BB", "description": "(2 Credits)\nThis applied course introduces students to the \nbasics of experimental design and data analysis.\n Emphasis will be placed on designing biological\n experiments that are suitable for statistical analysis, \nchoosing appropriate statistical tests to perform,\n and interpreting the results of statistical tests. We\n will cover statistical methods commonly used by \nbiologists to analyze experimental data, including \ntesting the fit of data to theoretical distributions,\ncomparisons of groups, and regression analysis. \nBoth parametric and non-parametric tests will be discussed. Students will use computer packages\n to analyze their own experimental data. Students \nmay receive credit for either BB 553 or a BB 570 \ncourse entitled Experimental Design and Statistics\n in the Life Sciences but not both.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
