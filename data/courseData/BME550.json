"{\"title\": \"TISSUE ENGINEERING\", \"level\": \"550\", \"abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"description\": \"This biomaterials course focuses on the selection, \\nprocessing, testing and performance of materials \\nused in biomedical applications with special\\n emphasis upon tissue engineering. Topics include \\nmaterial selection and processing, mechanisms \\nand kinetics of material degradation, cell-material \\ninteractions and interfaces; effect of construct architecture \\non tissue growth; and transport through\\n engineered tissues. Examples of engineering tissues\\n for replacing cartilage, bone, tendons, ligaments,\\n skin and liver will be presented. (Prerequisites: A first course in biomaterials equivalent \\nto BME/ME 4814 and a basic understanding \\nof cell biology and physiology. Admission of undergraduate students requires the permission of the instructor.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
