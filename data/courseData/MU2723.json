"{\"title\": \"MUSIC COMPOSITION\", \"level\": \"2723\", \"abbreviation\": \"MU\", \"description\": \"Cat. I \\n\\nThis course will investigate the sonic organization of musical works and\\nperformances, focusing on fundamental questions of unity and variety. Using a\\nprogressive series of composition projects, the class will examine aesthetic issues\\n that are considered in the pragmatic context of the instructions that composers\\n provide to achieve a desired musical result. The class will examine the medium\\n of presentation - whether these instructions are notated in prose, as graphic \\nimages, or in symbolic notation. Weekly listening, reading, and composition assignments draw on a broad range of musical styles and intellectual traditions,\\n from various cultures and historical periods.\\nThe class will meet for two weekly sessions of one hour and fifty minutes. \\nEach student will be assigned a performance ensemble. Each performance \\nensemble will have a weekly two-hour lab. In addition, each student will keep a weekly log (online) of his and her experiences as a composer.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
