{"title": "ROCKET PROPULSION", "level": "4719", "abbreviation": "AE", "description": "Cat. I \nThis course provides a study of rocket propulsion systems for launch vehicles and spacecraft. Dynamics, performance and optimization of rocket-propelled vehicles are presented. Performance and component analysis of chemical and electric propulsion systems are covered including thermochemistry of bipropellant and monopropellant thrusters. Additional topics may include advanced propulsion concepts and propellant storage and feed systems. \n\nRecommended background: compressible fluid dynamics (AE/ME 3410 or equivalent).", "req": [[["ME"], ["3410"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
