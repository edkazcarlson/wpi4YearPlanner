"{\"title\": \"INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUIDS\", \"level\": \"3602\", \"abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"description\": \"Cat. I \\nThis course covers inviscid and viscous incompressible fluid dynamics. Fundamental topics presented include: fluid kinematics and deformation; integral conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy for finite systems and control volumes; differential conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy; the Navier-Stokes equations. Applications will be considered from the following topics: hydrostatics; Bernoulli\\u2019s equation; the streamfunction and the velocity potential; incompressible, inviscid, irrotational (potential) flows; incompressible boundary layer flows; viscous incompressible steady internal and external flows; and dimensional analysis.\\n\\nRecommended background: thermodynamics (ES 3001, CH 3510 or equivalent).\", \"req\": [[[\"ES\"], [\"3001\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"3510\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
