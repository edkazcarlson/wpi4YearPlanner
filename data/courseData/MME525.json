"{\"title\": \"PROBABILITY, STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS II\", \"level\": \"525\", \"abbreviation\": \"MME\", \"description\": \"This course introduces students to probability, the\\n mathematical description of random phenomena, \\nand to statistics, the science of data. Students in\\n this course will acquire the following knowledge\\n and skills:\\n\\u2022 Probability models- mathematical models used\\n to describe and predict random phenomena.\\n Students will learn several basic probability\\n models and their uses, and will obtain experience \\nin modeling random phenomena.\\n\\n\\u2022 Data analysis- the art/science of finding patterns\\n in data and using those patterns to explain the\\nprocess which produced the data. Students \\nwill be able to explore and draw conclusions\\n about data using computational and graphical\\n methods. The iterative nature of statistical\\n exploration will be emphasized.\\n\\n\\u2022 Statistical inference and modeling- the use of\\n data sampled from a process and the probability \\nmodel of that process to draw conclusions \\nabout the process. Students will attain\\n proficiency in selecting, fitting and criticizing\\n models, and in drawing inference from data.\\n\\u2022 Design of experiments and sampling studies\\n\\u2013  the proper way to design experiments and \\nsampling studies so that statistically valid inferences\\n can be drawn. Special attention will be\\n given to the role of experiments and sampling \\nstudies in scientific investigation. Through lab \\nand project work, students will obtain practical\\n skills in designing and analyzing studies and \\nexperiments. Course topics will be motivated\\n whenever possible by applications and\\n reinforced by experimental and computer lab\\nexperiences. One in-depth project per semester \\ninvolving design, data collection, and statistical\\n or probabilistic analysis will serve to integrate\\n and consolidate student skills and understanding.\\n Students will be expected to learn and use a \\nstatistical computer package such as MINITAB.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
