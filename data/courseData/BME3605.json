I (1/6 unit) \n\nThis laboratory-driven transport course provides hands-on experience in \nmeasuring heat, flow, and transport in biologically-relevant systems. Students\n gain an in-depth understanding of the course material from personal observations\n and measurements on model cardiovascular systems and connective tissues.\n Challenge-based laboratory projects will be assigned which will require the \nstudents to determine and execute effective test methods at their own pace in a \nteam setting and communicate their findings effectively. Systems modeled may\ninclude blood vessels, stenotic vessels, and aneurysms. Connective tissues tested\nmay include blood vessels and skin. \nRecommended background: Heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and transport (BME 2511 and ES 3002, ES 3003, or ES 3004 or equivalent).", "req": [[["BME"], ["2511"]], [["ES"], ["3002"]], [["ES"], ["3003"]], [["ES"], ["3004"]]], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
