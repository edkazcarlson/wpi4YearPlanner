"{\"title\": \"SOFT ROBOTICS\", \"level\": \"530\", \"abbreviation\": \"RBE\", \"description\": \"Soft robotics studies \\u201cintelligent\\u201d machines and devices that incorporate some form of compliance in their mechanics. Elasticity is not a byproduct but an integral part of these systems, responsible for inherent safety, adaptation and part of the computation in this class of robots. This course will cover a number of major topics of soft robotics including but not limited to design and fabrication of soft systems, elastic actuation, embedded intelligence, soft robotic modeling and control, and fluidic power. Students will implement new design and fabrication methodologies of soft robots, read recent literature in the field, and complete a project to supplement the course material. Existing soft robotic platforms will be available for experimental work.\\n  Prerequisites: Differential equations, linear algebra, stress analysis, kinematics, embedded programming.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
