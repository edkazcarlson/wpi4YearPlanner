"{\"title\": \"EXPLORING BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY\", \"level\": \"100X\", \"abbreviation\": \"BB\", \"description\": \"Life scientists are generating huge amounts of data on many different scales, from DNA and protein sequence, to information on biological systems such as protein interaction networks, brain circuitry, and ecosystems.  Analyzing these kinds of data requires quantitative knowledge and approaches using computer science and mathematics.  In this project-based course, students will use case studies to learn about both important biological problems and the computational tools and algorithms used to study them.  Students will study a sampling of topics in the field, including such areas as complex disease genetics, analysis of a flu epidemic, investigating antibiotic resistance, and understanding the behavior of swarms, such as schooling fish.  Computational tools explored will include both freely-available web-based tools as well as guided programming using Python.\\n     Recommended background: High school biology. Programming experience is not required.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
