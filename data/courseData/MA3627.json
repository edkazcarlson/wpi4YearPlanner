"{\"title\": \"INTRODUCTION TO THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTS\", \"level\": \"3627\", \"abbreviation\": \"MA\", \"description\": \"Cat. II\\n \\nThis course will teach students how to design experiments in order to collect meaningful data for analysis and decision making. This course continues the exploration of statistics for scientific and industrial applications begun in MA 2611 and MA 2612. The course offers comprehensive coverage of the key elements of experimental design used by applied researchers to solve problems in the field, such as random assignment, replication, blocking, and confounding. Topics covered include the design and analysis of general factorial experiments; two-level factorial and fractional factorial experiments; principles of design; completely randomized designs and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); complete block designs and two-way analysis of variance; complete factorial experiments; fixed, random, and mixed models; split-plot designs; nested designs. \\nRecommended background: Applied Statistics (MA 2611 and MA2612, or equivalent).\", \"req\": [[[\"MA\"], [\"2611\"]], [[\"MA\"], [\"2612\"]]], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": -1}"
