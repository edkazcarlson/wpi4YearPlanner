"{\"Course Name\": \"SUFFERING, HEALING & VALUES\", \"Course Level\": \"2732\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"PY\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nThis course examines medicine, not from a scientific or professional view, but from a specificallyhumanistic approach. Using essays, films, fiction, poetry and plays, we will aim to make explicit the moral values most deeply held by practitioners in the healing professions. What other kinds of values can get in the way of those most deeply held aims? What are the responsibilities of a medical professional in\\ntoday's society? What are the sources of those responsibilities? The course will focus both on professional and personal dilemmas and will help students think through some moral problems that are likely to confront them in their professional and personal lives. The class should also help prepare students to navigate through the tough moral issues they are likely to face, either as a medical\\nprofessional, a citizen, a parent, a child of parents, or as potentially a sick person themselves. This class proposes to grant students the reflective time to read some of the most eloquent authors on suffering, caretaking, and sickness (for example, Oliver Sacks, Jerome Groopman, Susan Sontag, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Tony Kushner, Tracy Kidder, Perri Klass, etc.) and to express their reflections on these\\nresources in effective communication.\\n     Recommended Background: PY/RE 1731 or an introductory level literature course.\\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2016\"}"
