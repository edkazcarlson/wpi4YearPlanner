"{\"title\": \"ROBOT CONTROL\", \"level\": \"502\", \"abbreviation\": \"RBE\", \"description\": \"This course demonstrates the synergy between the control theory and robotics through applications and provides an in-depth coverage of control of manipulators and mobile robots. Topics may include kinematic and dynamic models, trajectory and motion planning, feedback control, compliance and force control, impedance control, control of redundant manipulators, control of underactuated robots, adaptive robot control, integrated force and motion control, digital implementation of control laws, model identification and parameter estimation techniques. Course projects will emphasize modeling, simulation and practical implementation of control systems for robotic applications. (Prerequisites: Linear algebra; Differential equations; Linear systems and control theory as in ECE 504 or consent of the instructor.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
