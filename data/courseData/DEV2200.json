II\\nThe engineers and scientists of tomorrow have a crucial role to play in discovering and implementing solutions to daunting international challenges related to food, water, energy, sanitation and infrastructure. The urgency of such challenges grows alongside and increasingly globalized workplace, where a growing number of graduates find themselves working outside the US, and invited to engage cultures, worldviews, value systems and physical environments that are very unlike their own. This course prepares students with \\u2018global competency\\u2019, to enable them to more effectively and ethically tackle problems in the context of starkly different socioeconomic, political, social and physical realities. Students will develop the knowledge, skills and understanding required to consider, accommodate and effectively integrate contextual difference into engineering practice by exploring the complexity of project design, the potential for unintended consequences, and how technologies are transformed in different contexts. This course will prepare students for a broad range of international IQP and MQPs.\\nRecommended background: none.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": false, \"startYear\": -1}"
