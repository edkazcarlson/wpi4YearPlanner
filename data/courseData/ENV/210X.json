"{\"Course Name\": \"CLIMATE CHANGE, RESILIENCE, AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD\", \"Course Level\": \"210X\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ENV\", \"Course Description\": \"This course will examine climate change impacts through the lens of a number of emerging engineering challenges in the developing world, now and into the future. Beginning with an overview of climate change science, students will learn how rapidly changing ecological systems in turn affect a variety of human endeavors. The course will then explore case studies of human responses to these climatic changes in different countries faced with varied ecological, political, and cultural dynamics: mitigation efforts that aim to reduce the amount of future climate change; adaptation plans that anticipate high-probability future changes; and resiliency efforts that attempt to provide the ability to respond as circumstances evolve in as-yet unknown ways. At the end of this course, students will understand that they will be required to consider and incorporate climate change science \\u00ac\\u2013 and the expanding list of consequences from rapidly changing planetary conditions \\u00ac\\u00ac\\u2013 into almost every aspect of their professional lives\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
