"{\"Course Name\": \"ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD\", \"Course Level\": \"2600\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"ENV\", \"Course Description\": \"Cat. II\\nEnvironment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because\\nmany poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources \\nfor their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible\\n for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills \\nand resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is\\n completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However,\\n optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental\\no utcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and \\nthat environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course \\nwill examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the \\ndeveloping world through the insights and critiques of social science. Subjects \\ncovered include sustainable development, population, environmental risks,\\ngender, urbanization, environmental decision making, and non-governmental \\norganizations (NGOs). The goals of this course are to think critically about the \\nvarious links between environment and development and the role of governmental\\n and non-governmental organizations in promoting sustainable development \\nin the developing world.\\n     Recommended Background: ENV 1100\\n.\\nThis course will be offered in 2015-16, and in alternating years thereafter.\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": false, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": \"2015\"}"
