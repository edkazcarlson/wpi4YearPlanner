"{\"title\": \"CELLULAR ENGINEERING LAB\", \"level\": \"3813\", \"abbreviation\": \"BME\", \"description\": \"Cat. I (1/6 units)\\nThis laboratory-driven course provides hands-on experience in the application of bioengineering to control cellular processes. Students will be challenged to design an intervention to manipulate a specific cellular process (adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation) and use modern cellular and molecular biology tools to assess and refine their approach. Laboratory exercises will provide an overview of cell culture technique, microscopy and molecular probes, quantification of cell proliferation and migration, and assessment of cellular differentiation in the context of the assigned projects. Students will complete the project at their own pace in a team setting and communicate their findings effectively. \\nRecommended background: Basic chemistry (CH 1010 and CH 1020) and a solid knowledge of cell biology (BB 2550) or equivalent.\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"1010\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"1020\"]], [[\"BB\"], [\"2550\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
