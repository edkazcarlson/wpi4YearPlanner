Precursors and biomolecules that give rise to DNA, the mechanism of DNA replication, RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis are described in detail. In addition to mechanistic studies, regulation of these processes is covered as well as those of genetic mutation, DNA repair, and epigenetics. \\n  Recommended background: Knowledge of organic chemistry fundamentals as well as concepts including protein structure and folding, catalytic mechanics, enzyme kinetics, and ATP synthesis and hydrolysis mechanisms.
