"{\"title\": \"ADVANCED CRYPTOGRAPHY\", \"level\": \"673\", \"abbreviation\": \"ECE\", \"description\": \"This course provides deeper insight into areas \\nof cryptography which are of great practical and\\n theoretical importance. The three areas treated are \\ndetailed analysis and the implementation of cryptoalgorithms,\\n advanced protocols, and modern attacks\\n against cryptographic schemes. The first part\\n of the lecture focuses on public key algorithms, in\\nparticular ElGamal, elliptic curves and Diffie-\\nHellman key exchange. The underlying theory of\\n Galois fields will be introduced. Implementation\\n of performance security aspects of the algorithms \\nwill be looked at. The second part of the course \\ndeals with advanced protocols. New schemes for \\nauthentication, identification and zero-knowledge \\nproof will be introduced. Some complex protocols \\nfor real-world application\\u2014 such as key distribution \\nin networks and for smart cards\\u2014will be \\nintroduced and analyzed. The third part will look \\ninto state-of-the-art cryptoanalysis (i.e., ways to\\n break cryptosystems). Brute force attacks based\\n on special purpose machines, the baby-step giant-step\\n and the Pohlig-Hellman algorithms will be\\n discussed. (Prerequisites: ECE 578/ CS 578 or\\nequivalent background.)\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
