"{\"title\": \"ORGANIC SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS LABORATORY\", \"level\": \"2660\", \"abbreviation\": \"CH\", \"description\": \"Cat. I\\n \\nThe emphasis in CH 2660 is on fundamental techniques essential for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of organic compounds. These techniques include setting up, running and monitoring reactions, isolation and purification by solvent extraction, crystallization, distillation, and chromatographic techniques, followed by determination of physical properties and characterization by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Micro-synthetic methods and multi-step synthesis are introduced. This course differs from CH 2360 by providing in-depth experience with spectroscopic characterization of molecular structure and hands-on training operating core instruments in addition to methods of organic synthesis. This course is required for students majoring in chemistry, and is recommended for students majoring in biochemistry and disciplines outside of chemistry that desire a strong background in methods of organic synthesis and characterization.\\n  Recommended background: Fundamentals of chemistry (see CH1010, CH1020, CH1030) and chemical characterization techniques (see CH1040), basic chemistry laboratory techniques (e.g., basic chemical synthesis, spectral analysis and chemical separation skills).\", \"req\": [[[\"CH\"], [\"1010\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"1020\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"1030\"]], [[\"CH\"], [\"1040\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
