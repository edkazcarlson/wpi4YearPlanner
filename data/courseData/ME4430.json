{"title": "INTEGRATED THERMOMECHANICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS", "level": "4430", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "Cat. II\nCurrent state-of-the-art computer based methodologies used in the design and analysis\n of thermomechanical systems will be presented and illustrated by selected laboratory\n demonstrations, and used in projects. Projects will include thermal, mechanical,\n electronic, and photonic loads of steady state and dynamic nature and will integrate\n design, analysis, and testing. Students will prepare a technical report and present their\n results. Topics will include, but not be limited to, thermomechanics of fiber optic\n telecommunication cables, high-energy beam interactions with materials, shape \nmemory alloys, microelectronics, MEMS and mechatronics.\n \n     Recommended background: MA 2051, ES 2001, ES 2502, ES 3003, \nME 3901, and an introduction to design.\nThis course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter.", "req": [[["MA"], ["2051"]], [["ES"], ["2001"]], [["ES"], ["2502"]], [["ES"], ["3003"]], [["ME"], ["3901"]]], "cat1Status": false, "startYear": "2016"}
