"{\"Course Name\": \"STATISTICAL METHODS IN GENETICS AND BIOINFORMATICS\", \"Course Level\": \"504\", \"Dept Abbreviation\": \"BCB\", \"Course Description\": \"This course provides students with knowledge and \\nunderstanding of the applications of statistics in\\nmodern genetics and bioinformatics. The course \\ngenerally covers population genetics, genetic\\nepidemiology, and statistical models in bioinformatics.\\n Specific topics include meiosis modeling,\\nstochastic models for recombination, linkage and \\nassociation studies (parametric vs. nonparametric\\nmodels, family-based vs. population-based \\nmodels) for mapping genes of qualitative and \\nquantitative traits, gene expression data analysis,\\n DNA and protein sequence analysis, and molecular\\n evolution. Statistical approaches include log-likelihood \\nratio tests, score tests, generalized linear\\n models, EM algorithm, Markov chain Monte \\nCarlo, hidden Markov model, and classification\\n and regression trees. Students may not receive\\n credit for both BCB 4004 and BCB 504. (Prerequisite: \\nknowledge of probability and statistics at the\\n undergraduate level.)\", \"Requirements\": [], \"Is Cat 1\": true, \"Start Year For Cat 2\": -1}"
