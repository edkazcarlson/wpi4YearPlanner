"{\"title\": \"ADVANCED GAS DYNAMICS\", \"level\": \"5102\", \"abbreviation\": \"AE\", \"description\": \"(2 credits)\\nAn introduction to kinetic theory of gases and its application to equilibrium flows and flows with chemical, vibrational and translational nonequilibrium. Topics in kinetic theory also include the Boltzmann Equation and its relation to the continuum equations of gas dynamics. A major focus of the course is exploring how results for equilibrium flow of a perfect gas (e.g. flows in nozzles, normal and oblique shocks, expansion waves) are modified for an imperfect gas with nonequilibrium. The models of flow with nonequilibrium are then applied to the study of different flows of engineering interest including hypersonic flows (e.g. re-entry vehicles), propagating shock waves (explosions), and chemically reacting flows. Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have taken the Special Topics (ME 593G) version of the same course or ME 512.\", \"req\": [], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
