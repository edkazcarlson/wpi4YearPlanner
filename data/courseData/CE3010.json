I\\n \\nThis course provides an understanding of the practice of structural engineering. \\nIt builds upon the fundamental skills developed in CE 2000, CE 2001, and \\nCE 2002 to present the principles of structures and their elements. The course\\n provides a perspective for dealing with the issues of strength, stiffness, and stability. Although wood is the principle material used to develop the study of\\n the interrelationship between analysis and design of structural systems, structural\\n steel and reinforced concrete systems are also discussed. It also introduces \\nstudents to the use of building codes for design criteria. The role of the\\n structural engineer in the design process and cost factors are also discussed.\\n \\nRecommended background: CE 2000, CE 2001, and CE 2002.\\nSuggested background: CE 1030.\", \"req\": [[[\"CE\"], [\"2000\"]], [[\"CE\"], [\"2001\"]], [[\"CE\"], [\"2002\"]], [[\"CE\"], [\"1030\"]]], \"cat1Status\": true, \"startYear\": -1}"
