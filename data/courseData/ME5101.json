{"title": "FLUID DYNAMICS", "level": "5101", "abbreviation": "ME", "description": "This course presents the following fundamental topics in fluid dynamics: concept of continuum in fluids; kinematics and deformation for Newtonian fluids; \n the mass conservation equation for material volumes and \ncontrol volumes; the differential form of mass conservation, momentum and energy equations. This course covers applied topics chosen from:\n unidirectional steady incompressible viscous flows; unidirectional transient incompressible viscous flows; lubrication flows similarity and dimensional analysis. This is an introductory graduate-level course and may be taken independent of AE 5107/ME 5107.", "req": [], "cat1Status": true, "startYear": -1}
