This course specifically\n addresses the unique role of biomaterials \nin medical device design and the use of emerging \nbiomaterials technology in medical devices. The\n need to understand design requirements of medical\ndevices based on safety and efficacy will be \naddressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if\n testing fails to account for synergistic interactions \nfrom chronic loading, aqueous environments,\n and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies\n are readily available to assess accelerated effects of \nloading in physiologic-like environments. This \ncombined with subchronic effects of animal implants \nis a potential tool in assessing durability. It \nis difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total \nbiologic environment. The ultimate determination\n of safety comes not only from following the\n details of regulations, but with an understanding\n of potential failure modes and designs that lowers \nthe risk of these failures.
